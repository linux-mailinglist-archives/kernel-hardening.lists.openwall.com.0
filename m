In earlier threads it was pointed out that one way to make things less
predictable was to do the calculation at the end of a syscall so that it
was more distant from entering userspace (with the thinking that things
like rdtsc were more predictable by userspace if it was always happening
X cycles after entering a syscall). Additionally, the idea of using
percpu meant that the chosen values wouldn't be tied to a process,
making even "short" syscalls (i.e. getpid) less predictable because an
attacker would need to have pinned the process to a single CPU, etc.

I can include these details more explicitly in the next change log, if
you think that makes sense?

Yes, it's intentional -- the 0x3ff limit is there to make sure the
alloca has a distinct upper bound, and the 8 bits is there to let the
compiler choose how much of those 8 bits it wants to throw away to stack
alignment. The limit to "at most 8 bits" (really 5) is chosen as a
middle ground between raising unpredictability without shrinking the
available stack space too much. (Note that arm64's alignment has to
tweak this by 1 more bit, so it is masking with 0x1ff.

I could attempt to adjust the comments to reflect these considerations.

I think this was discussed at some point too, though my search-foo is
failing me. I'm open to adding this to the mix, though care is needed
for both stack address and stack canary values, since they both have
specific structure (i.e. high and low bits of address are "known", and
low bits of canary are always zero) and we don't want to run the risk
of entangling secret values: if one can be exposed, does the entangling
expose the others?

I've had to deal with both of these issues with the slab freelist pointer
obfuscation, so my instinct here is to avoid mixing the other values in.
I'm open to improving it, of course, but I think rdtsc is a good first
step.
