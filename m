Right. The idea being that when a tasklet is stored in memory, it no
longer contains both the callback function pointer AND the argument to
pass it. This is the same problem that existed for struct timer_list.
You can see more details about this in at the start of the timer_list
refactoring:
https://git.kernel.org/linus/686fef928bba6be13cabe639f154af7d72b63120

Kind of. In the timer_list case, there were some places were actual data
(and not a pointer) was being passed -- those needed some thought to
convert sanely. I'm hoping that the tasklets are a much smaller part of
the kernel and won't pose as much of a problem, but I haven't studied
it.

Right:

struct ar_context {
	...
        struct tasklet_struct tasklet;
};

static void ar_context_tasklet(unsigned long data)
{
        struct ar_context *ctx = (struct ar_context *)data;
...

static int ar_context_init(...)
{
	...
        tasklet_init(&ctx->tasklet, ar_context_tasklet, (unsigned long)ctx);


this could instead be:

static void ar_context_tasklet(struct tasklet_struct *tasklet)
{
	struct ar_context *ctx = container_of(tasklet, typeof(*ctx), tasklet);
...

static int ar_context_init(...)
{
	...
        tasklet_setup(&ctx->tasklet, ar_context_tasklet);

Yes, the final step in the refactoring would be to modify the tasklet_init()
prototype. I've included some example commits from the timer_list
refactoring, but look at the history of include/linux/timer.h and
kernel/time/timer.c for more details.

I would expect the refactoring to follow similar changes to timer_list:

- add a new init API (perhaps tasklet_setup() to follow timer_setup()?)
  that passes the tasklet pointer to tasklet_init(), and casts the
  callback.
	https://git.kernel.org/linus/686fef928bba6be13cabe639f154af7d72b63120
- convert all users to the new prototype
	https://git.kernel.org/linus/e99e88a9d2b067465adaa9c111ada99a041bef9a
- remove the "data" member and convert the callback infrastructure to
  pass the tasklet pointer
	https://git.kernel.org/linus/c1eba5bcb6430868427e0b9d1cd1205a07302f06
- and then clean up anything (cast macros, etc)
	https://git.kernel.org/linus/354b46b1a0adda1dd5b7f0bc2a5604cca091be5f

Hopefully tasklet doesn't have a lot of open-coded initialization. This
is what made timer_list such a challenge. Stuff like this:
	https://git.kernel.org/linus/b9eaf18722221ef8b2bd6a67240ebe668622152a

It's a reduction in attack surface (attacker has less control
over the argument if the function pointer is overwritten) and it
provides a distinct prototype for CFI, to make is separate from other
functions that take a single unsigned long argument (e.g. before the
timer_list refactoring, all timer callbacks had the same prototype as
native_write_cr4(), making them a powerful target to control on x86).

For examples of the timer_list attacks (which would likely match a
tasklet attack if one got targeted), see "retire_blk_timer" in:
https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/05/exploiting-linux-kernel-via-packet.html

There's also some more detail on the timer_list work in my blog post
for v4.15:

Awesome!

Thanks for looking at this! I hope it's not at bad as timer_list. :)
