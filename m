Is gpm running with the needed permissions already?

Don't do that :)

You allowed a root-permissioned program to accept unsolicted network
code, why is it the kernel's issue here?

Have you verified that nothing will break with this?

If so, it needs to be submitted in a form that could be accepted (this
one was not, so I couldn't take it even if I wanted to), and please add
a tested-by from you and we will be glad to reconsider it.
