Not only. GFP_REPEAT being another one and probably others I cannot
remember from the top of my head.

The allocator can assume that caches with a constructor will initialize
the object so additional zeroying is not needed. GFP_ZERO should be self

Agreed. Over optimization based on an artificial workloads tend to be
dubious IMHO.
