This is going to generate a lot of code duplication (or at least object 
duplication),
as the two code paths are intricately linked and splitting them to 
support different
compilation options and/or calling conventions.

I'm not fundamentally opposed to that, but it should come with ways to 
still
manage it as a unified code base as much as possible, as ways to discard 
the
unused part at runtime (which should become easy to do once we have two
distinct sets of objects).
