It's even worse with partially-pre-moderated lists, because then list
moderators are forced to either accept all the mostly off-topic messages
(as some follow-ups from other lists would get through anyway, and would
be out of context if a message in a thread were rejected) or switch the
list to fully pre-moderated with no exceptions for anyone (and then it's
more work and greater delays on desirable messages).

I already brought this up with Mauro off-list, and I hope we'll see no
more of these threads on kernel-hardening, but we'll have to let the
rest of already started threads through.

I think this has significant negative effect on the kernel-hardening
project, shifting it further towards and beyond security circus (to
non-security circus now) and thereby discouraging desirable
contributions, whereas the (one relevant) file rename is unimportant
(and buried in lots of other renames).
