I don't care much whether it's "to the Openwall list" or not, but I do
feel that actual kernel hardening discussions are hampered by the
administrivia, no matter where they occur.  I suggested an easy way to
remove a small portion of the administrivia (by far not all of it, but
a portion that's the easiest to remove): drop the list from MAINTAINERS.
Unfortunately, this contributed to the split of the list in two, which
I'm concerned might not work well.  If I knew where this would lead, I
wouldn't have suggested that.

Sure.  I never suggested we could fix that with moderation.

I thought it wasn't an absolute requirement to have a mailing list
specified for every entry in MAINTAINERS, but if it is then I'm fine
with replacing the two mentions of kernel-hardening in MAINTAINERS with
another list, and I'm also fine with keeping kernel-hardening in there
if the alternative is even worse.

Right, but like you say this is challenging.  It's a surprise to me it
worked OK for a few days, and I doubt that will always be the case.

> The challenge is whether we can get people to subscribe to two lists,

If 100% of the topics on linux-hardening are supposed to be a subset of
what was on kernel-hardening, I think it'd be OK for me to provide the
subscriber list to a vger admin, who would subscribe those people to
linux-hardening.  However, after that point the subscriber lists will
start to differ, and that's actually what we should want if we want a
split of topics at all.  If the same sets of people were on both lists
at all times, then there's obviously no point in the split.

This also happens the other way around - an architectural discussion can
result in many administrivia sub-threads resulting from patch review.

Right, and this is also why I wouldn't have suggested splitting the
kernel-hardening list, and found this so problematic.  I just felt the
two mentions in MAINTAINERS were unlikely to result in such problems (if
removed or re-pointed to elsewhere), based on what I saw directed to
kernel-hardening via those so far (although I admit I have no reliable
way to determine why exactly a thread was CC'ed to kernel-hardening).
