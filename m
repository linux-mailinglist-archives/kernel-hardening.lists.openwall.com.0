IMO, you are smoking crack^H^H very seriously misunderstanding what
W^X is supposed to protect from.

W^X is not supposed to protect you from attackers that can already do
system calls. So loading code into a file then mapping the file as R-X
is in no way security hole in W^X.

If you want to provide protection from attackers that _can_ do system
calls, fine, but please don't talk about W^X and please specify what
types of attacks you want to prevent and why that's good thing.

Hint: attacker that can "Load the code into a file and map the file
with R-X." can probably also load the code into /foo and
os.system("/usr/bin/python /foo").

This is not first crazy patch from your company. Perhaps you should
have a person with strong Unix/Linux experience performing "straight
face test" on outgoing patches?

Best regards,
