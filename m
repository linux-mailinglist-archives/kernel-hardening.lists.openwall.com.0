Because for most/many of the kernel api, we don't have tests yet.  LTP
covers a lot of this type of thing, so no need to duplicate that.  But
yes, if you want to mandate this for your subsystem, that would be
great!

And many subsystems do mandate that, like drm and bpf.   So if you want
to bring the current LTP tty tests into the kernel test framework, I'll
gladly take those patches.

But I fail to see how this is relevant for this proposed change, which
would restrict access to an ioctl, how would a test help here?

thanks,

greg k-h
