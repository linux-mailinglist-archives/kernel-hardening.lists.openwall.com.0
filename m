Ideally there's a nice decoupling so the creating process is just manipulating "inert" data structures for the embryo that scheduler doesn't even need see, and then after the embryonic process is submitted, when the context switches to it for the first time that's a completely normal process without special cases.

Iiuc, you're talking about adding a thread into a thread-group tg1 from
a thread in another thread-group tg2. I don't think that's a very
pressing use-case and I agree that that sounds rather nasty right now.
Unless I'm missing something, a simple api to create something like a
processes configuration context doesn't require this.
