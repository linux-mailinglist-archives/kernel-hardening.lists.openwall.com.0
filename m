Hi Michal, thanks a lot for your thorough response. I'll address the
comments inline, below. Thanks also David and Mike - in fact, I almost
don't need to respond here after Mike, he was right to the point I'm
going to discuss heh...

Indeed, 24s of delay (!) is not so harmful for boot time, but...64G was
just my simple test in a guest, the real case is much worse! It aligns
with Mike's comment, we have complains of minute-like delays, due to a
very big pool of hugepages being allocated.

Users have their own methodology for allocating pages, some would prefer
do that "later" for a variety of reasons, so early boot time allocations
are not always used, that shouldn't be the only focus of the discussion
here.
In the specific report I had, the user complains about more than 3
minutes to allocate ~542G of 2M hugetlb pages.

Now, you'll ask why in the heck they are using init_on_alloc then -
right? So, the Kconfig option "CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON" is set
by default in Ubuntu, for hardening reasons. So, the workaround for the
users complaining of delays in allocating hugetlb pages currently is to
set "init_on_alloc" to 0. It's a bit lame to ask users to disable such
hardening thing just because we have a double initialization in hugetlb...

Thanks a lot for pointing the previous discussion for me! I should have
done my homework properly and read all versions of the patchset...my
bad! I'm glad to see this problem was discussed and considered early in
the patch submission, I guess it only missed more real-world numbers.

Your approach seems interesting, but as per Mike's response (which seems
to have anticipated all my arguments heheh) your approach is a bit
reversed, solving a ""non-existent"" problem (of zeroing hugetlb pages
in fault time), whereas the big problem hereby tentatively fixed is the
massive delay on allocation time of the hugetlb pages.

I understand that your suggestion has no burden of introducing more GFP
flags, and I agree that those are potentially dangerous if misused (and
I totally agree with David that __GFP_NOINIT_ON_ALLOC is heinous, I'd
rather go with the originally proposed __GFP_NO_AUTOINIT), but...
wouldn't it be letting the code just drive a design decision? Like "oh,
adding a flag is so bad..better just let this bug/perf issue to stay".

I agree with the arguments here, don't get me wrong - specially since
I'm far from being any kind of mm expert, I trust your judgement that
GFP flags are the utmost villains, but at the same time I'd rather not
change something (like the hugetlb zeroing code) that is not really
fixing the hereby discussed issue. I'm open to other suggestions, of
course, but the GFP flag seems the least hacky way for fixing that, and
ultimately, the flags are meant for this, right? Control page behavior
stuff.

About misuse of a GFP flag, this is a risk for every "API" on kernel,
and we rely in the (knowingly great) kernel review process to block
that. We could even have a more "terrifying" comment there around the
flag, asking new users to CC all relevant involved people in the patch
submission before using that...

Anyway, thanks a bunch for the good points raised here Michal, David and
Mike, and appreciate your patience with somebody trying to mess your GFP
flags. Let me know your thoughts!

Cheers,


Guilherme
