The cost of page clearing is mostly a constant overhead so it is quite
natural to see the time scaling with the number of pages. That overhead
has to happen at some point of time. Sure it is more visible when
allocating during boot time resp. when doing pre-allocation during
runtime. The page fault path would be then faster. The overhead just
moves to a different place. So I am not sure this is really a strong
argument to hold.

This is not really that important as long as you properly explain your
users what to expect from the default configuration. The hardening
aspect of this default might be really valuable but it comes with a
price. A non trivial one. The example you have highlighted is just one
from many. The one we can actually workaround although the more I think
about it the less I am convinced this is a good idea.

Effectively _any_ !__GFP_ZERO allocation suffers from double
initialization in one form or another. In the worst case the whole
content of the page gets overwritten. Consider any page cache allocation
for read for example.  This is GFP_*USER* request that gets overwritten
by the file content. Is this visible? Not really on a single page
but consider how many pages you read from disk and you will get a
considerable overhead. Should we exempt these allocations as well to
reduce the overhead? I dot think so. This directly undermines the
objective of the hardening. AFAIU the whole point of init_on_alloc is to
prevent from previous content leaking to a new user without relying the
new user is going to do right thing and initialize everything properly.

Hugetlb is no different here. It just doesn't bother to implement what
init_on_{alloc,free} promises. If there is a bug in hugetlb fault
handler then you can still leak data from one user to another
potentially. GFP_I_WANT_TO_OPT_OUT is actually allowing to increase the
number of users who would like to reduce overhead and risk data leak.
The power of unconditional initialization is in the fact that this is
clearly trivial to check that nothing gets missed.

It is not lame. It is expressing that people do not want to pay
additional price for the hardening or they are not aware of the cost
benefit here.

Yes, my approach is not great either because it breaks the core
assumption of init_on_alloc and that is that the initialization is done
at a well defined spot. It had to go to all callers of the hugetlb
allocator (alloc_buddy_huge_page) and fix them up. The proper thing to
do would be to do the initialization (or opt out if the page is
pre-zeroed either from the page allocator or from init_on_free) in
alloc_buddy_huge_page.

Been there done that. There were and still are many examples. I have
spent non-trivial time on clean ups. My experience is that the review
process simply doesn't stop random drivers or subsystems to do what they
think is right.

Been there done that. There is always room to improve though.
