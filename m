There is also the use case of noexec mounts and file permissions. From
user space point of view, it doesn't matter which kernel component is in
charge of defining the policy. The syscall should then not be tied with
a verification/integrity/signature/appraisal vocabulary, but simply an
access control one.

What about entrusted_access(2)? It reflects the fact that the kernel
delegate to (trusted) user space tasks some access enforcements.
