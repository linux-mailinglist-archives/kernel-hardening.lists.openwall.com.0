That's good to know, maybe they realized that they got it wrong later
on. Hopefully this can indicate that future models are not affected.

I don't think there are many more areas where the bootloader can
misbehave to a point where it will influence Linux (of course, that's
without mention of software running in the "secure" world, which can be
totally out of control as you know).

It is definitely a solution, but it comes with the constraint that it
must be able to run and act as a trampoline between the bootloader and
Linux. This means that the code must be able to deal with MMU and cache
enabled.

I would rather try to just write minimal code and make sure it
generally works. We can't really have any hard guarantee, but a program
that was shown to run over and over again without faulting is probably
good enough, since it would be very small.

I agree and while a U-Boot port is desirable, it's not the easiest
solution users to bootstrap mainline Linux on the device.

As far as I know, the few Android devices supported by mainline Linux
don't have similar issues (e.g. OMAP phones/tablets) so the situation
probably hasn't occured much.

Cheers,

Paul
