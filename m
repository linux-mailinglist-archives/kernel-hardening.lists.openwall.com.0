There is nothing magic, it doesn't only work with the LSM framework, and
there is nothing painful nor humiliating here (except maybe this language).

The check is done during open because the goal of this patch series is
to address the problem of script execution when opening a script in well
controlled systems (e.g. to enforce a "write xor execute" policy, to do
an atomic integrity check [1], to check specific execute/read
permissions, etc.). As discussed multiple times, controlling other means
to interpret commands (stdin, environment variables, etc.) is out of
scope and should be handled by interpreters (in userspace). Someone
could still extend fcntl(2) to enable to check file descriptors, but it
is an independent change not required for now.
Specific audit features are also out of scope for now [2].
