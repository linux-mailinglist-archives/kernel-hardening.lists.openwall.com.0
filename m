So what VMMs like qemu already do is prealloc/prefault all hugetlbfs
memory (if told to, because it's not desired when overcommitting memory)
- relevant for low-latency applications and similar.

https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/67e8498937866b49b513e3acadef985c15f44fb5/util/oslib-posix.c#L561

That's why starting a VM backed by a lot of huge pages is slow when
prefaulting: you wait until everything was zeroed before booting the VM.

Right, in case of QEMU if there are zeroed pages
a) prealloc would be faster
b) page faults would be faster

Also we could do hugetlb page clearing from a background thread/process,
as also mentioned by Michal.

Yes, but I guess we're past that: whatever leaves the buddy shall be
zeroed out. That's the whole point of that security hardening mechanism.
