Understood.  Maybe some other agreed-upon syntax would help - a new tag
letter in place of "L" and/or e-mail address obfuscation or an https URL
for further information instead of a direct posting address - but I
guess this is only worth introducing if we're not unique with this wish.

Thank you for your comments, Kees.

It's not a matter of my preference, but of what works best for getting
more actual work done.  Unfortunately, we have to make our subjective
guesses on this.  FYI, when we dropped the [kernel-hardening] prefix on
Subjects this appears to have resulted in some people unsubscribing.
I agree we had to do that anyway because of CC'ing other lists, which
is customary in Linux kernel development.  Before that change, we had a
slow but steady growth in the number of subscribers.  When we made that
change, the numbers of people joining and leaving became about the same,
so we're staying at 600 to 650 subscribed addresses for a long time now.
These numbers are fine by themselves; it's more relevant who is on the
list, not how many.  I think we might have "forced" some capable people
to unsubscribe, but like I explained we kind of had to.  Now I think
we're doing the same with these maintenance-only threads, and I think we
don't have to.  This is why I think we should preferably either somehow
limit the requested CC's to messages focused on core functionality, or
if we can't then drop the list references from MAINTAINERS.  We should
also not discuss this for very long, as this discussion itself hurts
actual work in a similar way.

Thank you for your comments as well, Tycho and Tobin.
