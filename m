IIRC shoot-downs are one of the reasons for using per-cpu PGDs which would
be a hard sell to some people.

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Where does this series stand? I don&#39;t think it ever got merge=
d?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There are sort of three components to this:<br>
&gt; 1. Basic PKS support. It was dropped after the main use case was<br>
&gt; rejected (pmem stray write protection).<br>
<br>
This was the main reason it got dropped.<br>
<br>
&gt; 2. Solution for applying direct map permissions efficiently. This<br>
&gt; includes avoiding excessive kernel shootdowns, as well as avoiding<br>
&gt; direct map fragmentation. rppt continued to look at the fragmentation<=
br>
&gt; part of the problem and ended up arguing that it actually isn&#39;t an=
<br>
&gt; issue [0]. Regardless, the shootdown problem remains for usages like<b=
r>
&gt; PKS tables that allocate so frequently. There is an attempt to address=
<br>
&gt; both in this series. But given the above, there may be lots of debate<=
br>
&gt; and opinions.<br>
&gt; 3. The actual protection of the PKS tables (most of this series). It<b=
r>
&gt; got paused when I started to work on CET. In the meantime 1 was<br>
&gt; dropped, and 2 is still open(?). So there is more to work through now,=
<br>
&gt; then when it was dropped.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If anyone wants to pick it up, it is fine by me. I can help with<br>

I can help with reviews as well,<br>
