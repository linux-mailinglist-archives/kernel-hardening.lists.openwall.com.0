Having just tried to implement this, it turns out they *are* related
and we can't still clear the base, I was wrong about that :( See below.

Fair enough about the kmem_cache, although I'm still worried about these
things getting bigger in future and the alignment having to increase at
the same time. We also have a bunch of static/percpu allocations that don't
use this cache.

Also, since you mentioned the lack of redzoning, isn't it a bit dodgy
allocating blindly out of the kmem_cache? It means we don't have a redzone
or a guard page, so if you can trigger something like a recursion bug then
could you scribble past the SCS before the main stack overflows? Would this
clobber somebody else's SCS? The vmap version that I asked Sami to drop
is at least better in this regard, although the guard page is at the wrong
end of the stack and we just hope that the allocation below us didn't pass
VM_NO_GUARD. Looks like the same story for vmap stack :/

I would like to remove the alignment requirements for the static and percpu
allocations. AFAICT, the only reason the alignment is needed is because you
want to convert an SCS pointer into the base pointer. The only reason *that*
is needed is because of the questionable wiping of the pointer in the
thread_info, but I really don't see the benefit of this. Unlike a crypto
secret (which was your analogy), the SCS pointer is stored in memory in
at least the following situations:

  * The task isn't running
  * The task is running in userspace
  * The task is running a vCPU in KVM
  * We're calling into EFI
  * On exception entry from EL1, as part of stacking x18
  * During CPU suspend

If we split the pointer in two (base, offset) then we could leave the
base live in the thread_info, not require alignment of the stacks (which
may allow for unconditional redzoning?) and then just update the offset
value on context switch, which could be trivially checked as part of the
existing stack overflow checking on kernel entry.

The base and offset can live in the same cacheline and be loaded with ldp,
so I don't see there being an access cost compared to a single variable.

Am I missing something (modulo us not agreeing on the utility of wiping
the pointer)?
