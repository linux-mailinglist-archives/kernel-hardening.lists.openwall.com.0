Hi Jann, thank you for reviewing this proposal.

Presumably, the interface should be used only when something has gone
wrong but has not been noticed by the kernel. That something is
usually checksums failures that are outside of the kernel: i.e. during
live migration, snapshotting, filesystem journaling, etc. We already
have interfaces that provide data from the live kernel that could be
racy, i.e. crash utility.

Since we are holding a reference on the page at the time of
dump_page(), the identity of the page should not really change, but
dentry can be renamed.

We use dump_page() all over WARN_ONs in MM code where pages might not
be locked, but this is a good point, that while even the existing
usage might be racy, providing a user-reachable API potentially makes
it worse. I will see if I could add some locking before dump_page(),
or make a dump_page variant that does not do dump_mapping().
