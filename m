I did some research about tracking memory footprint in VMs/Containers, =

This is a great starting task for me. So for this task, basically I need =
to add __must_check attribute to set_memory_*() functions and fix all =
the callers to make sure they check the return values. Do I understand =
correctly?

Also I have some other questions:
Is there any requirement for the patches? e.g. based on which kernel =
version? how many individual patches?

Thanks,
Tina
