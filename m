Can you clarify this a bit for those of us who are not well-versed in
exactly what "measurement" does?

I assume you mean that this has nothing specifically to do with
scripts, as IMA tries to protect ordinary (non-"execute" file access)
as well.  Am I right?

This seems consistent with my interpretation above, but ...

... I didn't follow this.

Suppose there's some valid contents of /bin/sleep.  I execute
/bin/sleep 1m.  While it's running, I modify /bin/sleep (by opening it
for write, not by replacing it), and the kernel in question doesn't do
ETXTBSY.  Then the sleep process reads (and executes) the modified
contents.  Wouldn't a subsequent attestation fail?  Why is ETXTBSY
needed?
