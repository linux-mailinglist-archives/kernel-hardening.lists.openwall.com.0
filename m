It still wouldn't be atomic (in the sense of parallelism, not in the
sense of intermediate error handling) though; for example, if task B
does setns(<pidfd_of_task_a>, 0) and task C concurrently does
setns(<pidfd_of_task_b>, 0), then task C may end up with the new mount
namespace of task B but the old user namespace, or something like
that. If C is more privileged than B, that may cause C to have more
privileges through its configuration of namespaces than B does (e.g.
by running in the &init_user_ns but with a mount namespace owned by an
unprivileged user), which C may not expect. Same thing for racing
between unshare() and setns().

Ah, good point, I didn't realize that that already exists for unshare().
