Yay!

I think it absolutely has value. The exploit techniques I'm aware of that
target the page table are usually attempting to upgrade an arbitrary
write into execution (e.g. write to kernel text after setting kernel
text writable in the page table) or similar "data only" attacks (make
sensitive page writable).

It looks like PKS-protected page tables would be much like the
RO-protected text pages in the sense that there is already code in
the kernel to do things to make it writable, change text, and set it
read-only again (alternatives, ftrace, etc). That said, making the PKS
manipulation code be inline to page-writing code would make it less
available for ROP/JOP, if an attack DID want to go that route.

The per-cpu-ness is really important for both performance and for avoiding
temporal attacks where an arbitrary write in one CPU is timed against
a page table write in another CPU.

What CPU models are expected to have PKS?

Ah, neat!

Ooh. What does this do for performance? It sounds like less TLB
pressure, IIUC?
