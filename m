Yes, there is. I am trying to emulate Ricoh 2A03 (RP2A03). That's the
slightly modified 6502 CPU used in the NES system. It's a really
well-documented platform so I chose that one to dip my toes in writing
virtualisation-related software.

I'm easily amused by debugging/instrumentation techniques and the
kernel has so many of them for various specific niches.

What really stood out at the time was learning how versatile ftrace can
be to the point that this "debugging/tracing" utility is one of the main
gears of kernel live patching. Initially it felt wrong but after
wrapping my head around it, that was a very creative solution.

That sounds like it's my cup of tea :) I just finished reading the Intel
CET paper, it's an interesting approach with lots of things to be
tested. Thanks for the recommendation, I will get involved with that.

Fingers crossed! I saw many patches for the strlcpy replacement so you
seem to be well covered for that... I will continue with the one-element
array changes and try to get involved with the support for Intel CET =)

Thanks for all the suggestions Kees!
