Let me share my 2 cents:

That permutation might be safe but afaict it hasn't been analyzed wrt
modern cryptographic techniques and there might well be differential
characteristics, statistical biases, etc.

What about just using SipHash's permutation, already in the kernel? It
works on 4*u64 words too, and 6 rounds would be enough.

Doing a basic ops count, we currently have 5 group operations and 3
rotations per round or 150 and 90 for the 30 init rounds. With SipHash it'd
be 48 and 36 with the proposed 6 rounds. Probably insignificant speed wise
as init is only done once but just to show that we'd get both better
security assurance and better performance.
