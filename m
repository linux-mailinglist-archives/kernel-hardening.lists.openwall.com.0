Thanks for the update! I wonder if there is a way to collaborate better
on this, so we're not all waiting on each other? (i.e. Romain got busy,
Allen picked up the work, then Allen got busy, then Oscar picked up the
work, then Allen returned, etc...)

Perhaps split up testing? I'll like you and Oscar work it out. :)

I think the "prepare" patches should be collapsed into the "convert"
patches (i.e. let's just touch a given driver once with a single patch).

Yup -- it's that first patch that needs to land in a release so the rest can start
landing too. (Timing here is the awkward part: the infrastructure change
needs to be in -rc1 or -rc2 so the next development cycle can use it
(i.e. subsystem maintainers effectively fork after the merge window is
over). We can play other tricks (common merged branch) but I don't think
that's needed here.

Thanks to all three of you for poking at this!
