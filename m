If we have to print the address, then kptr_restrict and dmesg_restrict
must be set properly so that unprivileged users cannot see them.

Yes, %pK (or %p) always hashes whether kaslr is disabled or not. So if
we want the real value of the address, we cannot use it. But if you only
want to distinguish if two pointers are the same, it's ok.
