OK, this is indeed the signature defined by the kernel API. What happen
if this API change (e.g. if struct sock is replaced with a struct
sock_meta)?

How does the verifier know a given BPF attachment point for a program
without relying on its type or attach type? How and where is registered
this mapping?

To say it another way, if there is no way to differentiate two program
targeting different hook, I don't understand how the verifier could
check if a given program can legitimately call a helper which could read
the tracer and tracee fields (legitimate for a ptrace hook), whereas
this program may be attached to a sock_rcv_skb hook (and there is no way
to know that).

I mentioned runtime check because I though a helper should handle the
case when it doesn't make sense for a program attached to a specific
point/hook (e.g. ptrace) to use an input argument (e.g. sk) defined for
another point/hook (e.g. sock_rcv_skb).

Thanks for this explanation Daniel.
