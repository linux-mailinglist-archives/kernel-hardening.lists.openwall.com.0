OK, I see what you mean now. Is there any way to special case the page
allocation for this feature? E.g. your implementation tries to make this
zeroying special but why cannot you simply do this


struct page *
____alloc_pages_nodemask(gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order, int preferred_nid,
							nodemask_t *nodemask)
{
	//current implementation
}

struct page *
__alloc_pages_nodemask(gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order, int preferred_nid,
							nodemask_t *nodemask)
{
	if (your_feature_enabled)
		gfp_mask |= __GFP_ZERO;
	return ____alloc_pages_nodemask(gfp_mask, order, preferred_nid,
					nodemask);
}

and use ____alloc_pages_nodemask from the slab or other internal
allocators?
