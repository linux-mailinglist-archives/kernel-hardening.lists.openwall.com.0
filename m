Well, yes. :) Maybe describe what the documentation covers instead here.
Regardless: yay docs! This is great.

Can you include some examples about what a user of landlock should do?
i.e. what are some examples of unexpected results when trying to write
policy that runs on top of overlayfs, etc?

With this series, can /proc (at the top level) be blocked? (i.e. can a
landlock user avoid the weirdness by making /proc/$pid/ unavailable?)

How was this value (64) chosen?
