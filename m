There is some wording in D4.4.5 (Behavior of caches at reset) that
suggests that implementations may permit cache hits in regions that
are mapped Non-cacheable (although the paragraph in question talks
about global controls and not page table attributes)

There is the NoSnoop PCIe issue as well: PCIe masters that are DMA
coherent in general can generate transactions with non-cacheable
attributes. I guess this is mostly orthogonal, but I'm sure it would
be much easier to reason about correctness if it is guaranteed that no
mappings with mismatched attributes exist anywhere.

Now that we have the pieces to easily remap the linear region down to
pages, and [apparently] some generic infrastructure to manage the
linear aliases, the only downside is the alleged performance hit
resulting from increased TLB pressure. This is obviously highly
micro-architecture dependent, but with Xgene1 and ThunderX1 out of the
picture, I wonder if the tradeoffs are different now. Maybe by now, we
should just suck it up (Note that we had no complaints afaik regarding
the fact that we map the linear map down to pages by default now)
