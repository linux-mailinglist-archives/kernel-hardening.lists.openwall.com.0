Ah, yes, I'm drawing a distinction here between "something has gone
wrong internally in the kernel and the kernel does some kinda-broken
best-effort self-diagnostics" and "userspace thinks something is
broken and asks the kernel".

Can you point me to where a refcounted reference to the page comes
from when page_detective_metadata() calls dump_page_lvl()?

To be clear, I am not that strongly opposed to racily reading data
such that the data may not be internally consistent or such; but this
is a case of racy use-after-free reads that might end up dumping
entirely unrelated memory contents into dmesg. I think we should
properly protect against that in an API that userspace can invoke.
Otherwise, if we race, we might end up writing random memory contents
into dmesg; and if we are particularly unlucky, those random memory
contents could be PII or authentication tokens or such.

I'm not entirely sure what the right approach is here; I guess it
makes sense that when the kernel internally detects corruption,
dump_page doesn't take references on pages it accesses to avoid
corrupting things further. If you are looking at a page based on a
userspace request, I guess you could access the page with the
necessary locking to access its properties under the normal locking
rules?

(If anyone else has opinions either way on this line I'm trying to
draw between kernel-internal debug paths and userspace-triggerable
debugging, feel free to share; I hope my mental model makes sense but
I could imagine other folks having a different model of this?)
