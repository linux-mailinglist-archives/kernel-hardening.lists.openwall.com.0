Yes, my bad on not being clear. Upstream glibc is a bit problematic to 
handle with clang. GRTE branches are kept within the glibc repository 
itself.

To the best of my knowledge there is no need for secrecy. Assuming that 
every indirect call / branch is preceeded with a hash set operation 
which will overwrite whatever was set by the attacker in R11, the 
control over its contents won't last until the branch (it will be 
destroyed before the call). Only non-instrumented indirect branches are 
left as entry-points for an attack based on controlling R11 to redirect 
control-flow and, yet, these cases would still be confined by the 
underlying coarse-grained policy.

Needless to say that ideally non-instrumented indirect branches 
shouldn't exist. That said, I don't know how likely it is to exist a 
non-instrumented indirect branch that can be hijacked, whose previous 
control-flow enables control over R11 and against which coarse-grained 
IBT isn't efficient. Either way, it seems to me that FineIBT imposes 
more constraints to these specific scenarios. Please, let me know if I'm 
not seeing a corner case here.

Nop. Addresses reached through direct calls don't need endbr. When I say 
that the "direct calls have their targeted addresses incremented by an 
offset" this is done statically by the compiler and the call remains a 
direct one. For each function, we only have one endbr which is 
positioned before the hash check.

This is my general feeling too. Given that one of the objectives of this 
implementation is to improve performance over what Clang CFI provides, 
I'm a bit overly concerned about how to properly optimize here. It is 
good to hear that you have similar thoughts.

To some extent this is more an ABI thing. The X86-64 ABI requires 
cross-compatibility for new features. I'm still thinking and considering 
different designs for the whole DSO support which could possibly 
overcome this but *if* this is considered reasonable, then perhaps it 
could be added to the ABI, what would eventually lead to the support 
being added to GCC, GLIBC, and all other toolchain components.

I haven't. On a CET-enabled environment, these unintended gadgets would 
need to be preceded with an endbr instruction, otherwise they won't be 
reachable indirectly. I assume that these cases can still exist 
(specially in the presence of things like vulnerable BPF JIT or if you 
consider full non-fineibt-instrumented functions working as gadgets), 
but that this is a raised bar. Besides that, there are patches like this 
one (which unfortunately was abandoned) that could come handy:

https://reviews.llvm.org/D88194

I heard that GCC had a different way for handling this and I don't know 
the current status in Clang, if the feature was totally abandoned or 
merged with a different approach.

Agreed. Sounds like a valid experiment.

Hm. Haven't thought about per-boot permutations. It is an interesting 
idea, sure, but I'm not fully convinced that it is needed given the 
discussion on secrecy above. I *think* that usable gadgets under CET 
(and under FineIBT) are a rare thing. I don't want to say the famous 
last words here, so I'll just leave it open until I have any kind of 
actual measurement.

No. The last time I checked IBT support within the kernel was still 
under development (I'm not following it closely). Since this is a 
requirement for FineIBT, I didn't give much care to this scenario yet.

For instrumenting assembly, well, I had to handle these in GLIBC and 
MUSL when I played with it. Lots of things, for the sake of prototyping, 
were solved by adding the coarsecfcheck attribute to the functions, 
which would render C functions callable from uninstrumented assembly. In 
the other direction, assembly prologues were instrumented with endbr + 
padding nops to fit the prologue length. Given that assembly needs to 
have prologues instrumented with endbr for the basic IBT to work, this 
is not a big hassle to add the nops there. Another interesting thing 
here is that IBT is enforced regardless of FineIBT, so even if you are 
just prototyping or can't clearly assume that a function will always be 
called under a prototype-matching suitable context, there will always be 
the coarse-grained grid under the fine-grained which is being disabled. 
Not the best scenario, but better than fully disabling CFI and allowing 
completely arbitrary branches.

Me too :)

Provided sources should be assumed "prototype-grade", but I think they 
can handle some heavy tasks, given that I was able to compiler/run SPEC 
with it. There are some recent fixes which I still need to push, but 
these are slowing being merged.

Well, being this a side-project, I don't have a super solid path in my 
head. As said before, I'm exploring other approaches for handling 
cross-DSOs while also waiting for the IBT support to land on the Kernel. 
I'll try to find some time to do the gadget measurement.

Sure. I'll try to keep the list posted on any future pushes. And thanks 
again for the feedback.
