Ah yes, good point. Is FOLL_FORCE used in the other places as well? I'd
really like to find way to make this change architecture-agnostic.

This is mainly about upstream acceptability: using CONFIGs for these
kinds of things is frowned upon because it means that distro kernel
users can't use the feature (since distros won't enable the CONFIG since
it absolutely breaks known userspace workflows). So a static branch
(with its default controlled by CONFIG) means that everyone can use it,
embedded or not.

Thanks for chasing this problem down! If you comment on the bug, I can
mark it as assigned to you, if want?
