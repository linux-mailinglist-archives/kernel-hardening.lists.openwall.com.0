Except for development and test purposes, being able to use root
(without CAP_SYS_CHROOT) would now enable to easily remove ambient
filesystem access. Indeed, thanks to openat2 with RESOLVE_BENEATH or
RESOLVE_IN_ROOT, it would be simple for most processes to chroot/chdir
into an empty directory after opening (or being given) file descriptors
opened with RESOLVE_BENEATH (e.g. configuration directory, cache
directory, data directory, etc.). We can get something really close to a
security capability system (different than POSIX capabilities), which
wasn't possible when Andy posted the previous patches, and can help
improve the state of userspace security.

It is already possible to limit ptrace-like attacks, even when multiple
processes are running with the same UID, with the help of SELinux, or
even simply with Yama. This already enables sysadmins or distros to
harden their system, and this kind of restrictions (with additional
access-control bits) will be available to userspace developers thanks to
Landlock.

OK, I would be a bit bigger patch but easier to read.
