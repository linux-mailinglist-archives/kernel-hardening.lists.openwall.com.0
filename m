I have a patch set to convert the remaining tasklet usage in sound
drivers to either the threaded IRQ or the work, but it wasn't
submitted / merged for 5.8 due to the obvious conflict with your API
changes.
Each conversion is rather simple, but it's always a question of the
nature of each tasklet usage which alternative is the best fit.

FWIW, the current version is found in test/kill-tasklet branch of
sound git tree
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git


thanks,

Takashi
