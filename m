But you have a single quarantine (per CPU) for all objects, right? So
for a UAF on slab A, the attacker can just spam allocations and
deallocations on slab B to almost deterministically flush everything
in slab A back to the SLUB freelists?

Not as far as I can tell.

Just as some more context of how I think about this:

Preventing memory corruption, outside of stuff like core memory
management code, isn't really all *that* hard. There are schemes out
there for hardware that reliably protects the integrity of data
pointers, and such things. And if people can do that in hardware, we
can also emulate that, and we'll get the same protection in software.

The hard part is making it reasonably fast. And if you are willing to
accept the kind of performance impact that comes with gigantic
quarantine queues, there might be more effective things to spend that
performance on?
