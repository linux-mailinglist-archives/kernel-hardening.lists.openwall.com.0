Oh, please, don't mix up everything.  First, this is an RFC, and as I
explained, the goal is to start a discussion with something concrete.
Second, doing a one-time check on a file and providing guarantees for
the whole lifetime of an opened file requires different approaches,
hence this O_ *proposal*.

It would be interesting to know how to patch user space to get the same
guarantees...  Do you think I would propose a kernel patch otherwise?

Jann explained it very well, and the deny-write for execve is still
there, but let's keep it civil.  I already agreed that this is not a
good approach, but we could get interesting proposals.
