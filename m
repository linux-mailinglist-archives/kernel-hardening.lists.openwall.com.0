Yes.

Yes, and this is still in the hands sysadmins.

As explain in the documentation patch, the sysctl takes a bitfield
consisting of "mount !noexec" or "file exec permission". It is not an
exclusive OR. The "file exec permission" could be seen as a more strict
restriction than only the mount one.

The initial goal of O_MAYEXEC (in CLIP OS 4) is to prevent untrusted
code execution. Code execution leads to system calls, which could lead
to data access/modification, and kernel attacks. seccomp can't enable
execution of only some files, it only enables an on/off execution policy
(i.e. by filtering execve(2) ).

Yes, I explain the thread model, especially the risk of scripts.
Multilevel isolation can be bypassed simply by using CPU instructions
(e.g. side channel attacks), not even syscalls. The ability to execute
arbitrary code, including advanced scripting languages, can lead to this
kind of CPU attacks.

Unfortunately, as discussed in the v2 email thread [1], if we impose
such restrictions with the O_MAYEXEC flag, then almost no userspace
application will use it because it could cause unexpected behavior.
Indeed, the application developers may not know the configuration of the
system their applications will be run on. Only sysadmins know the mount
points configuration (either they are have noexec or not), and if the
set of application installed on the system works well with the set of
files (e.g. according to their permissions). It is the same issue as
with a system-wide LSM policy configuration. Processes should be able to
tell their use of a file, but the sysadmin using common distro binaries
should be able to control the execution policy according to the maturity
of the current system installation.

However, for fully controlled distros such as CLIP OS, it make sense to
enforce such restrictions at kernel build time. I can add an alternative
kernel configuration to enforce a particular policy at boot and disable
this sysctl.
