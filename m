Good point.

I was thinking that mitigation against timing attacks is the same
irrespective of the source of the attack. However, because the HV
controls CPU time allocation, there are presumably attacks that
are made much easier through the HV. Those should be listed.

You mean host secureboot? Or guest?

If it=E2=80=99s host, then the problem is detecting malicious tampering wit=
h
host code (whether it=E2=80=99s kernel or hypervisor).

If it=E2=80=99s guest, at the moment at least, the measurements do not exte=
nd
beyond the TCB.
