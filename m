May be worth checking which relocation or (SHT_GROUP section's sh_info) in arch/arm64/kernel/head.o is incorrect.

Full/Thin LTO should work with GNU ld and gold with LLVMgold.so built from
llvm-project (https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html ). You'll need to make sure
that LLVMgold.so is newer than clang. (Newer clang may introduce bitcode
attributes which are unrecognizable by older LLVMgold.so/ld.lld)
