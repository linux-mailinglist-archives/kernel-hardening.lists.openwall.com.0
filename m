We are willing to collaborate with the Landlock developers and come up
with a common approach that would work for Landlock and KRSI. I want
to mention that this collaboration and the current Landlock approach
of using an eBPF based LSM for unprivileged sandboxing only makes sense
if unprivileged usage of eBPF is going to be ever allowed.

Purely from a technical standpoint, both the current designs for
Landlock and KRSI target separate use cases and it would not be
possible to build "one on top of the other". We've tried to identify
the lowest denominator ("eBPF+LSM") requirements for both Landlock
(unprivileged sandboxing / Discretionary Access Control) and KRSI
(flexibility and unification of privileged MAC and Audit) and
prototyped an implementation based on the newly added / upcoming
features in BPF.

We've been successfully able to prototype the use cases for KRSI
(privileged MAC and Audit) using this "eBPF+LSM" and shared our
approach at the Linux Security Summit [1]:

* Use the new in-kernel BTF (CO-RE eBPF programs) [2] and the ability
  of the BPF verifier to use the BTF information for access validation
  to provide a more generic way to attach to the various LSM hooks.
  This potentially saves a lot of redundant work:

   - Creation of new program types.
   - Multiple types of contexts (or a single context with Unions).
   - Changes to the verifier and creation of new BPF argument types 
     (eg. PTR_TO_TASK)

* These new BPF features also alleviate the original concerns that we
  raised when initially proposing KRSI and designing for precise BPF
  helpers. We have some patches coming up which incorporate these new
  changes and will be sharing something on the mailing list after some
  cleanup.

We can use the common "eBPF+LSM" for both privileged MAC and Audit and
unprivileged sandboxing i.e. Discretionary Access Control.
Here's what it could look like:

* Common infrastructure allows attachment to all hooks which works well
  for privileged MAC and Audit. This could be extended to provide
  another attachment type for unprivileged DAC, which can restrict the
  hooks that can be attached to, and also the information that is
  exposed to the eBPF programs which is something that Landlock could
  build.

* This attachment could use the proposed landlock domains and attach to
  the task_struct providing the discretionary access control semantics.
