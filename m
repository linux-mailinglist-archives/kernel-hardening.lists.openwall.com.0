Ah yes, that's fair: the shell would discover the malicious library
while using AT_CHECK during resolution of the LD_PRELOAD.

But we have launchers that apply arbitrary seccomp policy, e.g. minijail
on Chrome OS, or even systemd on regular distros. In theory, this should
be handled via other ACLs.

If flexibility costs us reliability, I think that flexibility is not
a benefit.

Yeah, I do recognize that is feels much more natural, but I remain
unhappy about how difficult it will become to audit a system for safety
when the check is strictly per-process opt-in, and not enforced by the
kernel for a given process tree. But, I think this may have always been
a fiction in my mind. :)

Hm, as in, make a separate call to open(2) without O_MAYEXEC, and pass
that fd back to the filtered open(2) that did have O_MAYEXEC. Yes, true.

I guess it does become morally equivalent.

Okay. Well, let me ask about usability. Right now, a process will need
to do:

- should I use AT_CHECK? (check secbit)
- if yes: perform execveat(AT_CHECK)

Why not leave the secbit test up to the kernel, and then the program can
just unconditionally call execveat(AT_CHECK)?

Though perhaps the issue here is that an execveat() EINVAL doesn't
tell the program if AT_CHECK is unimplemented or if something else
went wrong, and the secbit prctl() will give the correct signal about
AT_CHECK availability?
