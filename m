What I mean is that the kernel won't have access to the actual source
PC. If I followed your v1 correctly, it works by making any branch to
the trampoline code trigger a page fault. At this point, the PC has
already been updated to the trampoline entry, so the only thing the
fault handler can know is the return address on the top of the stack,
which (a) might not be where the branch actually originated, either
because it was a jump, or you've already been hacked and you got here
using a ret; (b) is available to userspace anyway.

I'm not asking how it's implemented. I'm asking what's the point? On a
typical linux system, at least on x86, every library function call is an
indirect branch. The protection they get is that the dynamic linker can
map the pointer table read-only after initializing it.

For the RO mapping, libffi could be mapping both the entire closure
structure, as well as the structure that describes the arguments and
return types of the function, read-only once they are initialized.

For libffi, there are three indirect branches for every trampoline call
with your suggested trampoline: one to get to the trampoline, one to
jump to the handler, and one to call the actual user function. If we are
particularly concerned about the trampoline to handler branch for some
reason, we could just replace it with a direct branch: if the kernel was
generating the code, there's no reason to allow the data pointer or code
target to be changed after the trampoline was created. It can just
hard-code them in the generated code and be done with it. Even with
user-space trampolines, you can use a direct call. All you need is
libffi-trampoline.so which contains a few thousand trampolines all
jumping to one handler, which then decides what to do based on which
trampoline was called. Sure libffi currently dispatches to one of 2-3
handlers based on the ABI, but there's no technical reason it couldn't
dispatch to just one that handled all the ABIs, and the trampoline could
be boiled down to just:
	endbr
	call handler
	ret

/If/ you are using a trampoline created by the kernel, it can just
create the one that libffi is using today; which doesn't need trapping
into the kernel at execution time.

And if you aren't, you can use the trampoline I wrote, which has no
dynamic code, and doesn't need to trap into the kernel at execution time
either.

How can you still say this after this whole discussion? Applications can
get the exact same functionality as your proposed trampfd using static
code, no W^X tricks needed.

This only matters if you have a trampfd that generates _truly_ dynamic
code, not just code that can be trivially made static.
