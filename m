Urgh, that sounds nasty. The thing is, as I've hinted at in my other
reply, I would really like a compiler switch to disable this
optimization entirely -- knowing how relevant the trnaformation is, is
simply a first step towards that.

In order to control the tranformation, you have to actually know where
in the optimization passes it happens.

Also, if (big if in my book) we find the optimization is actually
beneficial, we can invert the warning when using the switch and warn
about lost optimization possibilities and manually re-write the code to
use control deps.

I was going to suggest: if this happens, employ -fno-wreck-dependencies
:-)
