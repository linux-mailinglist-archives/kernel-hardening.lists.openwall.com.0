Not sure I understand, the temporary mm is only in use for kernel
patching in this series. We could have other uses in the future maybe
where it's beneficial to keep mappings local.

I suppose that's an option, but then we have to save and restore the
mapping which we temporarily "steal" from userspace. I admit I didn't
consider that as an option when I started this series based on the x86
patches. I think it's cleaner to switch mm, but that's a rather weak
argument. Are you concerned about performance with the temporary mm?
