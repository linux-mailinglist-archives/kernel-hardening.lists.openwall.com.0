Yes.

Because limiting horisontal movement between components is still valuable.

It's an example. If kernel was 100% secure we won't need KASLR. Nothing
ever is though.

Right. My point was that trying to show how CC usecases are similar to other
existing ones will be more helpful for everyone than just focusing on how they
are different. I hope I was able to show some similarities.
