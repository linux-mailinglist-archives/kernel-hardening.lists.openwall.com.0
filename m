The problem in the example is that sudo executed unpriv process which then =
re-gained the privs of sudo itself. It doesn't need to be sudo or even root=
 - the same problem affects all containers/sandboxes (privileged or not) in=
 linux - the (supposedly) contained process can use TIOCSTI/TIOCLINUX to br=
eak out of the container/sandbox (unless they're blocked as well).

BTW: you seem in favor of restricting TIOCSTI [1] which landed in kernel so=
 why suddenly question same problem here?
