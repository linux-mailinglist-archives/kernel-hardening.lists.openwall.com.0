Hi!

Thanks for re-considering this patch set!

Yes, this should work.

GPM runs as root with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (and many others).

I did not mean to imply that ping runs as root due to the setuid flag.  In =
this
scenario, ping runs as a normal user with only a few additional networking
capabilities (as I believe it is common on most distributions now?).

Also, as Landlock is a sandboxing feature, it makes sense to assume from th=
at
perspective that the confined process is already hostile.

So the privilege boundary that the example is about is not that the ping pr=
ocess
was successfully attacked (that is a problem too), but it is that the
now-hostile ping process can escape the sandbox through the TTY file descri=
ptor.

It is the *shell* which has more privileges for accessing *files* than the =
ping
process has.  This is because the ping process has self-confined itself wit=
h a
Landlock sandbox before it was attacked, and therefore ping itself only has=
 very
limited access to files.

ping is indeed a bit unusual because of the special capabilities it needs -=
- the
same example would also apply to netcat, or any other Unix utility which
commonly gets invoked from the command line, which processes untrusted inpu=
t,
and which should sandbox itself.

Not yet, but I am happy to try it out.

Thanks, will do.

In my understanding from the thread, the outstanding problems that were
discussed were:

 - compatibility with GPM -- I can try this out.
 - clarification of why this is needed -- I hope the additional
   discussion in this thread has clarified this.
 - submittable "form"

By the non-submittable "form", I assume you mean the formatting and maybe
phrasing of the e-mail, so that it can be cleanly applied to git?  Or was t=
here
anything in the code which I missed?

Thanks,
