Huh.  This thing is unchanged since 2.6.12-rc2, back in 2005:

static inline int list_empty_careful(const struct list_head *head)
{
	struct list_head *next = head->next;
	return (next == head) && (next == head->prev);
}

I can imagine compiler value-caching optimizations that would cause
trouble, for example, if a previous obsolete fetch from head->prev was
lying around in a register, causing this function to say "not empty" when
it was in fact empty.  Of course, if obsolete values for both head->next
and head->prev were lying around, pretty much anything could happen.

In the delete-only case, I kind of get it, other than the potential for
optimization.  Once the list becomes empty, it will forever remain empty.
And the additional test of head->prev avoids this returning true while the
deletion is half done (again, aside from the potential for optimization).

If insertions are allowed, the thing I haven't quite figured out yet is
what is being gained by the additional check of head->prev.  After all,
if updates are not excluded, the return value can become obsolete
immediately anyhow.  Yes, it could be used as a heuristic, but it could
report empty immediately before a list_add(), so there would need to
either be a careful wakeup protocol or a periodic poll of the list.

Or am I missing a trick here?
