What I mean is that we already have a good middle-ground. It doesn't
need to be all (general distro) or nothing (embedded build). Once the
workload for the system is known, load the needed modules and block
everything else. i.e. set up a module alias named "disable", and then
fill /etc/modules with whatever you might want that isn't automatically
loaded at boot and end the list with "disable". I wrote this up almost
exactly 10 years ago:
