Hi Kees,

Someone has already volunteered.  I'd also like to hear from someone
possibly not as over-qualified and as busy as that person is. ;-)

Kees, if you'd like to step down as a co-moderator for kernel-hardening,
please let me know.  We'll add someone else (so that this doesn't depend
solely on me being around).

To avoid misinterpretation: I am not suggesting that you need to step
down, totally not.  I merely feel that you need to have the option since
you expressed unhappiness with having to spend effort on that.

It is weird that I now feel I have to spell it out explicitly, but I do,
so: Kees, please don't use my saying that I don't want to continue this
bikeshed discussion "for very long" as an excuse for lack of
coordination on your part, again.  That's not a valid excuse, nor do you
need one.  You can always coordinate with me off-list if you prefer, but
I don't mind this thread continuing on the list for a little while.

We need you to comment on the above.  I hope you did have some idea of
how the topics would be split between the two lists, but you haven't
really specified that yet.  I tried to make guesses in the paragraph
above, so at least you need to confirm whether my guesses are correct,
or correct me if they are not.

I see there are already a few threads on linux-hardening, and those are
not CC'ed to kernel-hardening.  I am pleasantly surprised that those
threads are about rather minor changes, which while acceptable to have
on kernel-hardening as well IMO do not add much value to discussions
desirable on kernel-hardening: "Replace one-element array with
flexible-array member", "Use flex_array_size() helper", "Use
array_size() helper", "Replace one-element array and save heap space",
"Use fallthrough pseudo-keyword".

I think topics more desirable on kernel-hardening would be deciding on
such replacements in general (not patches for individual instances),
introduction of such helpers, etc.  Also summaries of work done (e.g.,
"this-many instances of that-thing were updated to new conventions in
the kernel over the last month as discussed in those threads seen in
that list archive").  I use examples from the past because that's what
we have, but I use them to illustrate roughly what kinds of things we
could possibly have on one list vs. the other in the future.

Thanks,

Alexander
