I'd been thinking of ->d_fsdata pointing to a structure with list_head
and a (non-counting) task_struct pointer for those guys.  Allocated
on lookup, of course (as well as readdir ;-/) and put on the list
at the same time.

IOW, for short-lived process we simply have an empty (h)list anchored
in task_struct and that's it.
