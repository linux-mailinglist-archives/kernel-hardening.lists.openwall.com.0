For glibc, I plan to add an environment variable to disable the lockout.
There's no ELF markup that would allow us to do this during dlopen.
(And after this change, you can run an old distribution in a chroot
for legacy software, something that the userspace ABI break prevents.)

If it can be disabled, people will definitely say, =E2=80=9Cwe get more com=

hardening if we break old userspace=E2=80=9D.  I want to avoid that.  (Peop=
le
will say that anyway because there's this fairly large window of libcs
that don't use vsyscalls anymore, but have not been patched yet to do
the lockout.)

Maybe the lockout also simplifies the implementation?

I admit I only looked at the code in emulate_vsyscall.  It has code that
seems to deal with faults not due to instruction fetch, and also checks
for vsyscall=3Demulate mode.  But it seems that we don't get to this point
for reads in vsyscall=3Demulate mode, presumably because the page is
already mapped?

Should the "[vsyscall]" string change to something else if execution is
disabled?

Thanks,
Florian
