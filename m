I think it would make more sense to scope access to abstract unix
sockets: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231025.eecai4uGh5Ie@digikod.net/

A complementary approach would be to restrict socket creation according
to their properties:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/b8a2045a-e7e8-d141-7c01-bf47874c7930@digikod.net/

I agree. It should not be too difficult to add a new LSM path hook for
connect (and sendmsg) to named unix socket with the related access
rights.  We should be careful about the impact on sendmsg calls though.

seccomp_unotify enables user space to emulate syscalls, which requires a
service per sandbox. seccomp is useful but will always be delicate to
use and to maintain the related filters for sandboxing use cases:
https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2003/traps-and-pitfalls-practical-problems-system-call-interposition-based-security-tools/

Anyway, I'd be happy to help improve Landlock with new access control
types.

FYI, TCP connect and bind access control should be part of Linux 6.7:
