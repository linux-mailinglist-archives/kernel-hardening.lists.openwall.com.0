Why do we need to do it in 2022? These *all* pci devices work.

Compliance tests?

Like Greg already said, this is a small drop in a ocean which needs to be changed.

However even in mentioned by me case, you are not fixing but hiding real
problem of having broken device in my machine. It is worst possible solution
for the users.

Let's don't call bug for something which is not.

Random crashes are much more tolerable then "working" device which sends
random results.

Not really, we are arguing what is the right thing to do:
1. Fix a root cause - device
2. Hide the failure and pretend what everything is perfect despite
having problematic device.
