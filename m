FYI, script execution is being addressed (for the kernel part) by this
patch series:

It doesn't make sense for a tailored security system to leave all these
tools available to an attacker.

Not all kernel features make sense for a generic/undefined usage,
especially specific security mechanisms (e.g. SELinux, Smack, Tomoyo,
SafeSetID, LoadPin, IMA, IPE, secure/trusted boot, lockdown, etc.), but
they can still be definitely useful.
