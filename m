SCS would actually provide another way to do return hooking. An arguably
much saner model at that.

The 'normal' way is to (temporary) replace the on-stack return value,
and then replace it back in the return handler. This is because we can't
simply push a fake return on the stack, because that would wreck the
expected stack layout of the regular function.

But there is nothing that would stop us from pushing an extra entry on
the SCS. It would in fact be a much cleaner solution. The entry hook
sticks an extra entry on the SCS, the function ignores what's on the
normal stack and pops from the SCS, we return to the exit handler, which
in turn pops from the SCS stack at which point we're back to regular.

The only 'funny' is that the exit handler itself should not push to the
SCS, or we should frob the return-to-exit-handler such that it lands
after the push.

AFAICT you also need to kill KRETPROBES, which plays similar games. And
doesn't BPF also do stuff like this?
