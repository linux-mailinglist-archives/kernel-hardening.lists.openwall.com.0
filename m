+Attacks against vulnerable userspace applications with the purpose to bre=
ak ASLR
+or bypass canaries traditionaly use some level of brute force with the he=
lp of
+the fork system call. This is possible since when creating a new process =
using
+fork its memory contents are the same as those of the parent process (the
+process that called the fork system call). So, the attacker can test the =
memory
+infinite times to find the correct memory values or the correct memory ad=
dresses
+without worrying about crashing the application.
+
+Based on the above scenario it would be nice to have this detected and
+mitigated, and this is the goal of this implementation.
+
+
+Other implementations

+
+The public version of grsecurity, as a summary, is based on the idea of d=
elay
+the fork system call if a child died due to a fatal error. This has some =
issues:
+
+Bad practices
+-------------
+
+Add delays to the kernel is, in general, a bad idea.
+
+Weak points
+-----------
+
+This protection can be bypassed using two different methods since it acts=
 only
+when the fork is called after a child has crashed.
+
+Bypass 1
+~~~~~~~~
+
+So, it would still be possible for an attacker to fork a big amount of ch=
ildren
+(in the order of thousands), then probe all of them, and finally wait the
+protection time before repeat the steps.
+
+Bypass 2
+~~~~~~~~
+
+This method is based on the idea that the protection doesn't act if the p=
arent
+crashes. So, it would still be possible for an attacker to fork a process=
 and
+probe itself. Then, fork the child process and probe itself again. This w=
ay,
+these steps can be repeated infinite times without any mitigation.
+
+
+This implementation
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+The main idea behind this implementation is to improve the existing ones
+focusing on the weak points annotated before. The solution for the first =
bypass
+method is to detect a fast crash rate instead of only one simple crash. F=
or the
+second bypass method the solution is to detect both the crash of parent a=
nd
+child processes. Moreover, as a mitigation method it is better to kill al=
l the
+offending tasks involve in the attack instead of use delays.
+
+So, the solution to the two bypass methods previously commented is to use=
 some
+statistical data shared across all the processes that can have the same m=
emory
+contents. Or in other words, a statistical data shared between all the fo=
rk
+hierarchy processes after an execve system call.
+
+The purpose of these statistics is to compute the application crash perio=
d in
+order to detect an attack. This crash period is the time between the exec=
ve
+system call and the first fault or the time between two consecutives faul=
ts, but
+this has a drawback. If an application crashes once quickly from the exec=
ve
+system call or crashes twice in a short period of time for some reason, a=
 false
+positive attack will be triggered. To avoid this scenario the shared stat=
istical
+data holds a list of the i last crashes timestamps and the application cr=
ash
+period is computed as follows:
+
+crash_period =3D (n_last_timestamp - n_minus_i_timestamp) / i;
+
+This ways, the size of the last crashes timestamps list allows to fine tu=
ning
+the detection sensibility.
+
+When this crash period falls under a certain threshold there is a clear s=
ignal
+that something malicious is happening. Once detected, the mitigation only=
 kills
+the processes that share the same statistical data and so, all the tasks =
that
+can have the same memory contents. This way, an attack is rejected.
+
+Per system enabling
+-------------------
+
+This feature can be enabled at build time using the CONFIG_SECURITY_FORK_=
BRUTE
+option or using the visual config application under the following menu:
+
+Security options  --->  Fork brute force attack detection and mitigation
+
+Per process enabling/disabling
+------------------------------
+
+To allow that specific applications can turn off or turn on the detection=
 and
+mitigation of a fork brute force attack when required, there are two new =
prctls.
+
+prctl(PR_SECURITY_FORK_BRUTE_ENABLE, 0, 0, 0, 0)  -> To enable the featur=
e
+prctl(PR_SECURITY_FORK_BRUTE_DISABLE, 0, 0, 0, 0) -> To disable the featu=
re
+
+Fine tuning
+-----------
+
+To customize the detection's sensibility there are two new sysctl attribu=
tes
+that allow to set the last crashes timestamps list size and the applicati=
on
+crash period threshold (in milliseconds). Both are accessible through the
+following files respectively.
+
+/proc/sys/kernel/brute/timestamps_list_size
+/proc/sys/kernel/brute/crash_period_threshold
+
+The list size allows to avoid false positives due to crashes unrelated wi=
th a
+real attack. The period threshold sets the time limit to detect an attack=
. And,
+since a fork brute force attack will be detected if the application crash=
 period
+falls under this threshold, the higher this value, the more sensitive the
+detection will be.
