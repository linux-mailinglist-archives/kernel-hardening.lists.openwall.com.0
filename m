Subject: Re: [RFC PATCH 1/5] security : hardening : prevent write to proces's

Hi Kees,

The patch you referred to is scoped in /proc fs.

There is a chance that hackers may use other attack methods except procfs.
There is process_vm_writev syscall , /dev/mem.
An attacker can also hijack one of the process threads and write to
read-only pages.
I admit that I am the newbie and lack knowledge, but I think my
solution is more generic and protects from more possible attacks.
Second, you suggested to control it in run-time with a knob.
I think that configuration option I propose better fit embedded system needs.
There is no need in an embedded system to turn it on/off since there is no gdb.
(the same argument for a production system),  These systems are locked
down, and perhaps the proper place to put this option is in lockdown
LSM.
Thank you for your response.
Lev
