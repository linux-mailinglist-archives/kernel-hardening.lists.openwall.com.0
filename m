Hello!

+CC the people involved in TIOCSTI

This patch seems sensible to me --
and I would like to kindly ask you to reconsider it.

This patch only affects TIOCLINUX subcodes which are responsible for text
cut-and-paste, TIOCL_SETSEL, TIOCL_PASTESEL and TIOCL_SELLOADLUT.

The only program that I am aware of which uses cut&paste on the console is =
gpm.
My web searches for these subcode names have only surfaced Linux header fil=
es
and discussions about their security problems.

It's the same problem as with TIOCSTI, which got (optionally) disabled for
non-CAP_SYS_ADMIN in commit 83efeeeb3d04 ("tty: Allow TIOCSTI to be disable=
d")
and commit 690c8b804ad2 ("TIOCSTI: always enable for CAP_SYS_ADMIN").

The number of exploits which have used TIOCSTI in the past is long[1] and h=
as
affected multiple sandboxing and sudo-like tools.  If the user is using the
console, TIOCLINUX's cut&paste functionality can replace TIOCSTI in these
exploits.

We have this problem with the Landlock LSM as well, with both TIOCSTI and t=
hese
TIOCLINUX subcodes.

Here is an example scenario:

* User runs a vulnerable version of the "ping" command from the console.

* The "ping" command is a hardened version which puts itself into a Landloc=
k
  sandbox, but it still has the TTY FD through stdout.

* Ping gets buffer-overflow-exploited by an attacker through ping responses=
.

* The attacker can't directly access the file system, but the attacker can
  escape the sandbox by controlling the surrounding (non-sandboxed) shell o=
n its
  terminal through TIOCLINUX.

The ping example is not completely made up -- FreeBSD had such a vulnerabil=
ity
in its ping utility in 2022[2].  The impact of the vulnerability was mitiga=
ted
by FreeBSD's Capsicum sandboxing.

The correct solution for the problem on Linux is to my knowledge to create =
a
pty/tty pair, but that is somewhat impractical for small utilities like pin=
g, in
order to restrict themselves (they would need to create a sidecar process t=
o
shovel the data back and forth).  Workarounds include setsid() and seccomp-=
bpf,
but they also have their limits and are not a clean solution.  We've previo=
usly
discussed it in [3].

I do believe that requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for TIOCLINUX's TIOCL_PASTESEL su=
bcode
would be a better approach than so many sudo-style and sandboxing tools hav=
ing
to learn this lesson the hard way.  Can we please reconsider this patch?
