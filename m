There's "good first issue" label that might help you choose things:
https://github.com/KSPP/linux/labels/good%20first%20issue

One mostly mechanical bit of work would be this:
https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/20
There are likely more fixes needed to build the kernel with
-Wcast-function-type (especially on non-x86 kernels). So that would let
you learn about cross-compiling, etc.

Let us know what you think!

Take care,
