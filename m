Yes, that was the plan once Joe's patch gets merged (if it does), and my
patch was only an example of using stracpy, as a step on the road. I was
intending to follow up with a patch converting stracpy to something like
https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2019/07/06/14

__FORTIFY_INLINE ssize_t strscpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t 
count)
{
	size_t dest_size = __builtin_object_size(dest, 0);
	size_t src_size = __builtin_object_size(src, 0);
	if (__builtin_constant_p(count) &&
	    __builtin_constant_p(src_size) &&
	    __builtin_constant_p(dest_size) &&
	    src_size <= count &&
	    src_size <= dest_size &&
	    src[src_size - 1] == '\0') {
		strcpy(dest, src);
		return src_size - 1;
	} else {
		return __strscpy(dest, src, count);
	}
}

which, as a macro, would become

#define stracpy(dest, src)						\
({									\
	size_t count = ARRAY_SIZE(dest);				\
	size_t dest_size = __builtin_object_size(dest, 0);		\
	size_t src_size = __builtin_object_size(src, 0);		\
	BUILD_BUG_ON(!(__same_type(dest, char[]) ||			\
		       __same_type(dest, unsigned char[]) ||		\
		       __same_type(dest, signed char[])));		\
									\
	(__builtin_constant_p(count) &&					\
	 __builtin_constant_p(src_size) &&				\
	 __builtin_constant_p(dest_size) &&				\
	 src_size <= count &&						\
	 src_size <= dest_size &&					\
	 src[src_size - 1] == '\0') ?					\
		(((size_t) strcpy(dest, src)) & 0) + src_size - 1	\
	:								\
		strscpy(dest, src, count);				\
})

and both of these get optimised to movs when copying a constant string
which fits in the target.

I was going at this from the angle of improving the existing APIs and
their resulting code. But I like your approach of failing at compile
time.

Perhaps we could do both ;-).
