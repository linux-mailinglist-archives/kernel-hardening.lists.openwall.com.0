Most daemons have some supervisor that respawns them when they crash. 
(maybe read up on "supervisor trees" if you haven't, it's a standard concept)

That's usually (but not) always init, as in systemd. There might be something
inbetween it and init, but likely init would respawn the something in between
it it. One of the main tasks of init is to respawn things under it.

If you have a supervisor tree starting from init the kill should eventually
travel up to init.

At least that's the theory. Do you have some experiments that show
this doesn't happen?

At least the part of systemd that respawns is often (but not always) init.

sshd would be respawned by the supervisor, which is likely init.

If the system is part of some cluster, then panicing on attack or failure
could be a reasonable reaction. Some other system in the cluster should
take over. There's also a risk that all the systems get taken
out quickly one by one, in this case you might still need something
like the below.

But it's something that would need to be very carefully considered
for the environment.

The other case is when there isn't some fallback, as in a standalone
machine.

It could be only used when the supervisor daemons are aware of it.
Often they already have respawn limits, but would need to make sure they
trigger before your algorithm trigger. Or maybe some way to opt-out 
per process.  Then the DoS would be only against that process, but
not everything on the machine. 

So I think it needs more work on the user space side for most usages.
