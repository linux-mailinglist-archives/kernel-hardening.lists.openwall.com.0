This feature can indeed also be used to monitor files requested by
scripts to be executed e.g. using
https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.open_code

IMA/EVM can include this check in its logs.

Yes. You should only need to implement security_bprm_creds_for_exec()
for IMA/EVM.

BTW, I noticed that IMA only uses the security_bprm_check() hook (which
can be called several times for one execve), but
security_bprm_creds_for_exec() might be more appropriate.
