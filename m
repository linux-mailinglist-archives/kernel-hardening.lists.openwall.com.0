Great!

But the seccomp filter can be set to kill the process, so that's 
definitely not the safest way. I think safest is that when the AT_FLAGS 
bit is seen, ld.so doesn't do any mprotect() calls but instead when 
mapping the segments, mmap() flags are adjusted to include PROT_BTI, so 
mprotect() calls are not necessary. If there's no seccomp filter, 
there's no disadvantage for avoiding the useless mprotect() calls.

I'd expect the backported kernel change to include both aux vector and 
also using PROT_BTI for the main executable. Then the logic would work 
with backported kernels as well.

If there's no aux vector, all bets are off. The kernel could be old and 
unpatched, even so old that PROT_BTI is not known. Perhaps also in the 
future there may be new technologies which have replaced BTI and the 
kernel could want a previous generation ld.so not to try to use BTI, so 
this could be also indicated with the lack of aux vector. The dynamic 
loader could still attempt to mprotect() the pages, but that could be 
fatal. Getting to the point where the error can be ignored means that 
there's no seccomp filter, at least none set to kill. Perhaps the pain 
is only temporary, new or patched kernels should eventually replace the 
old versions.

Saving a few system calls is indeed not an issue, but not being able to 
use MDWX and PROT_BTI simultaneously was the original problem (service 
failures).
