My review of v6 suggested dropping the -ffixed-x18 as well, since it's only
introduced by SCS (in patch 5) and so isn't required by anything else. Why
do you think it's needed?

That's a good point, and I agree that it would be nice to have SCS covering
the VHE paths. If you do that as a function attribute (which feels pretty
fragile to me), then I guess we'll have to keep the -ffixed-x18 for the
non-VHE code after all because GCC at least doesn't like having the register
saving ABI specified on a per-function basis.
