First of all thank you for the review!

I had actually planned to move all this code into lib/code-patching.c
directly (and it turns out that's what x86 ended up doing as well).

For kernel threads 'current->mm' is NULL since a kthread does not need
a userspace mm; however they still need a mm so they "borrow" one which
is indicated by 'current->active_mm'.

'current->mm' needs to be restored because Hash requires a non-NULL
value when handling a page fault and so 'current->mm' gets set to the
temp_mm. This is a special case for kernel threads and Hash translation.

Hmm, I will have to investigate this more. I'm not sure if there is a
better way to just completely disable breakpoints while the temporary mm
is in use.

I've found other places (even in arch/powerpc!) where this is done so I
think it's fine. I prefer using this style when the variable
declaration and initialization are "close" to the loop statement.
