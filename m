I have never seen a significant performance impact. Performance and
size is better on more recent versions of gcc as it has better
generation of PIE code (for example generation of switches).

I agree that it would add GOT references and I can explore that more
in terms of performance impact and size. This patchset makes the GOT
readonly too so I don't think the attack vector applies.

I assume you mean mcmodel=large, it doesn't use it. It uses -fPIE and
removes -mcmodel=kernel. It favors relative references whenever
possible.
