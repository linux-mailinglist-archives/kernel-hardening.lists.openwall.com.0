No worries ;-)

These changes looks comprehensive and definitely fix current issue.

Thanks for pointing to that discussion. Definately both of that changes fix 
problems which I've described (and not only that). However, what are the 
reasons behind not merging them in? Especially, the first part (exec_id) looks 
harmless and don't require any other updates.

Thanks :) However, I did not focus on optimizing the '*exec_id overflow' 
scenario and that's certainly possible. E.g. by creating the code as small as 
possible, don't link with external libraries (or statically compile them in), 
etc. In such case the time will be significantly smaller.

Another interesting fact (not possible for performing 'overflow' attack but 
worth to mention) is that we might increment '*exec_id' and force execve() to 
fail. Function load_elf_binary() calls setup_new_exec() (which increments the 
counter) and then continue execution of a more heavy work. In such case an 
'overflow' would be a matter of hours. However, search_binary_handler() 
function "protects" from such scenario and in case of error in 
load_elf_binary() sends SIGSEGV:

    int search_binary_handler(struct linux_binprm *bprm)
    {
    ...
        retval = fmt->load_binary(bprm);
    ...
        if (retval < 0 && !bprm->mm) {
            /* we got to flush_old_exec() and failed after it */
            read_unlock(&binfmt_lock);
            force_sigsegv(SIGSEGV, current);
            return retval;
        }
    ...
    }

flush_old_exec() is called before setup_new_exec().

Thanks,
Adam
