The ORC tables are though:

I was under the impression these tables no longer had relocation data;
that since they're part of the main kernel, the final link stage could
completely resolve them.

That said, I now see we actually have .rela__extable .rela.orc_unwind_ip
etc.

For now, yes. Depends a bit on how hard people are pushing on getting
jump_labels working earlier and ealier in boot.

Right.

I have some patches pending where we rely on link script order. That's
data sections though, so I suppose that's safe for the moment.
