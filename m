I would very much like to see a well-designed kernel facility for
helping userspace do JIT in a safer manner, but designing such a thing
is likely to be distinctly nontrivial.  To throw a half-backed idea
out there, suppose a program could pre-declare a list of JIT
verifiers:

static bool ffi_trampoline_verifier(void *target_address, size_t
target_size, void *source_data, void *context);

struct jit_verifier {
  .magic = 0xMAGIC_HERE,
  .verifier = ffi_trampoline_verifier,
} my_verifier __attribute((section("something special here?)));

and then a system call something like:

instantiate_jit_code(target, source, size, &my_verifier, context);

The idea being that even an attacker that can force a call to
instantiate_jit_code() can only create code that passes verification
by one of the pre-declared verifiers in the process.
