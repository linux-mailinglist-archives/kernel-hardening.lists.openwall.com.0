It was mentioned that it would re-use the base across syscalls, so this
defense would have frustrated it.

More to my point was that there still are attacks using a deterministic
stack as part of the exploit chain. We have a low-cost way to make that
go away.

IIRC, section 3.3 discusses using the stack for CFI bypass, though
thinking about it again, it may have been targeting pt_regs. I'll
double check and remove this reference if that's the case.

But, as I mention, this is proactive and I'd like to stop yet more
things from being able to depend on the stack location.
