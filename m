If you allow user namespaces and not idmapped mounts you haven't reduced
your attack surface. An unprivileged user can reach much more
exploitable code simply via unshare -user --map-root -mount which we
still allow upstream without a second thought even with all the past and
present exploits (see
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/29/1 for a current
one from this January).

A fully privileged user potentially being able to cause issues is really
not an argument; especially not for a new sysctl.
You need root to create idmapped mounts and you need root to turn off
the new knob.

It also trivially applies to a whole slew of even basic kernel tunables
basically everything that can be reached by unprivileged users after a
privileged user has turned it on or configured it.

After 2 years we haven't seen any issue with this code and while I'm not
promising that there won't ever be issues - nobody can do that - the
pure suspicion that there could be some is not a justification for
anything.
