Another good read:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150520005510.GA23559@linux.vnet.ibm.com/

and having (partially) re-read that, I now worry intensily about things
like latch_tree_find(), cyc2ns_read_begin, __ktime_get_fast_ns().

It looks like kernel/time/sched_clock.c uses raw_read_seqcount() which
deviates from the above patterns by, for some reason, using a primitive
that includes an extra smp_rmb().

And this is just the few things I could remember off the top of my head,
who knows what else is out there.
