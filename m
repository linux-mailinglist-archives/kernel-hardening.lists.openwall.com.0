Ok, got it. I didn't read far enough there.

I'd still like to avoid having it variable-length and structured though.
How about having a __u32 "options" flag, plus an indirect argument
with 32 fixed-length (all 32 bit or all 64 bit) flag words, each of which
corresponds to one of the option bits?

It's still fairly complex that way, but not as much as the version
you have right now that can be extended in multiple dimensions.

This could possibly also help avoid the need for the get_features
syscall: If user space just passes the bitmap of all the access flags
it wants to use in a fixed-size structure, the kernel can update the
bits to mask out the ones it does not understand and write back
that bitmap as the result of create_ruleset().

For behavior changing flags, I agree they should be seen as
incompatible flags (i.e. return an error if an unknown bit is set).

However, for the flags you pass in in an allowlist, treating them
as compatible (i.e. ignore any unknown flags, allowing everything
you are not forbidding already) seems completely reasonable
to me. Do you foresee user space doing anything other than masking
out the bits that the kernel doesn't know about? If not, then doing
it in the  kernel should always be simpler.

openat2() is already more complex than we'd ideally want, I think we
should try hard to make new syscalls simpler than that, following the
rule that any interface should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.

Clearly the target object is something different, but maybe there is
enough commonality to still make them fit into a more regular form.

For the file system case, you have an identify for an object
(the file descriptor) and the  '__u64 allowed_access'. I would
expect that the 'allowed_access' concept is generic enough that
you can make it a direct argument (32 bit register arg, or pointer
to a __u64). Do you expect others to need something besides
an object identifier and a permission bitmask? Maybe it could
be something like

 SYSCALL_DEFINE4(landlock_add_rule, int, ruleset, __u32, options,
                       const void __user *, object, const __u64 __user
*, allowed_access,
                       __u32, flags);

with a fixed-length 'object' identifier type (file descriptor,
sockaddr_storage, ...) for each option.
