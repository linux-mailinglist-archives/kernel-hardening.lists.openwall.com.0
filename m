Just fyi, I'm on holiday this week so my responses have some
non-significant lag into early next week.

So from what I can gather from this proposal, this would be a separate
security model for io_uring? I'm not to thrilled about that tbh. (There's
some discussion around extending seccomp - also at kernel summit.)
But doing the whole restriction setup in io_uring_setup() would at least
mean that if seccomp is extended to filter first-level pointers it could
know about all the security restrictions that apply to this io_uring
instance (Which I think you were getting at, Jann?).

Hm, would it make sense that if a task has a seccomp filter installed
that blocks openat syscalls that io_uring should automatically block
openat() calls as well or is the expectation "just block all of io_uring
if you're worried about that"?
