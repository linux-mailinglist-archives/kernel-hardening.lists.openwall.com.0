Thanks for pointing.
With that, now I read the full history of discussion regarding this :-)

Ya, now I see that in the description of this patch, sorry that I

snapshot seems to be the reasonable direction to go

Is this something related to the VMA ? e.g. preserve the in-memory
copy of the file when the file on fs was updated.

According to man mmap:
       MAP_PRIVATE
              Create a private copy-on-write mapping.  Updates to the
              mapping are not visible to other processes mapping the same
              file, and are not carried through to the underlying file.
              It is unspecified whether changes made to the file after
              the mmap() call are visible in the mapped region.

so the direction here is
the process -> update the vma -> doesn't carry to the file.

What we want is the reverse direction: (the unspecified part in the man pag=
e)
file updated on fs -> doesn't carry to the vma of this process.

right, me neither.
