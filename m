We discussed this with authors, but no integration work is happening
right now yet.
Yes, it would be useful for syzbot to do this assessment automatically
for all bugs and, say, tag bugs on the dashboard (less noisy then
sending separate emails). If/when syzbot sends, say, monthly
per-subsystem summary, that priority info could also be included
there.
