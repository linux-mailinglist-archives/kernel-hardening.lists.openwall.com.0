ACPI_ADR_SPACE_SYSTEM_MEMORY may be used for everything that is memory
mapped, i.e., PCIe ECAM space, GPIO control registers etc.

I agree that using ACPI_ADR_SPACE_SYSTEM_MEMORY for any memory that is
under the kernel's control is a bad idea, and this should be easy to
filter out: the SystemMemory address space handler needs the ACPI
support routines to map the physical addresses used by AML into
virtual kernel addresses, so all these accesses go through
acpi_os_ioremap(). So as a first step, it should be reasonable to put
a lockdown check there, and fail any access to OS owned memory if
lockdown is enabled, and print a warning if it is not.
