My intention was to find a clean way to isolate abstract sockets in network
applications without adding dependencies like LSMs. However the entire approach
of using namespaces for this is something I have mostly abandoned. LSMs like
Apparmor and SELinux would work fine for process isolation when you can control
the target system, but for general deployment of sandboxed processes, I found it
to be significantly easier (and more effective) to build this into the
application itself by using a multi process approach with seccomp (Basically how
OpenSSH did it)
