Good point: from the "resources granted to a user" perspective, that does
help bound their consumption. The nomenclature distinction seems like a
good one to have, but if "network namespaces" *change the meaning of the
term *and the original definition becomes "network device namespaces," then
there would be a period where older and newer kernels have very different
functions mapped to the same conceptual name. Might this make a bit more
sense as "network namespaces" meaning what they do now - "network device
namespaces," effectively; while the new concept would be "socket
namespaces" to account for the various socket style interfaces provided?

Thanks
-Boris
