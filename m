Can you give a worked-out example of how this is useful?

I assume the idea is that a program could open a file, then pass the
fd to execveat() to get the kernel's idea of whether it's permissible
to execute it.  And then the program would interpret the file, which
is morally like executing it.  And there would be a big warning in the
manpage that passing a *path* is subject to a TOCTOU race.

This type of usage will do the wrong thing if LSM policy intends to
lock down the task if the task were to actually exec the file.  I
personally think this is a mis-design (let the program doing the
exec-ing lock itself down, possibly by querying a policy, but having
magic happen on exec seems likely to do the wrong thing more often
that it does the wright thing), but that ship sailed a long time ago.

So maybe what's actually needed is a rather different API: a way to
check *and perform* the security transition for an exec without
actually execing.  This would need to be done NO_NEW_PRIVS style for
reasons that are hopefully obvious, but it would permit:

fd =3D open(some script);
if (do_exec_transition_without_exec(fd) !=3D 0)
  return;  // don't actually do it

// OK, we may have just lost privileges.  But that's okay, because we
meant to do that.
// Make sure we've munmapped anything sensitive and erased any secrets
from memory,
// and then interpret the script!

I think this would actually be straightforward to implement in the
kernel -- one would need to make sure that all the relevant
no_new_privs checks are looking in the right place (as the task might
not actually have no_new_privs set, but LSM_UNSAFE_NO_NEW_PRIVS would
still be set), but I don't see any reason this would be
insurmountable, nor do I expect there would be any fundamental
problems.

Can you explain what those bits do?  And why they're useful?

YEXEC

This one at least returns an fd, so it looks less likely to get
misused in a way that adds a TOCTOU race.
