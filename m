If these two rules are from different layers, then yes it would work as
intended. However, if these rules are from the same layer the path walk
will not stop at /usr/lib but go down to /usr, which grants write
access. This is the reason I wrote it like this and the
layout1.inherit_subset test checks that. I'm updating the documentation
to better explain how an access is checked with one or multiple layers.

Doing this way also enables to stop the path walk earlier, which is the
original purpose of this function.
