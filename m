My intention is to allow for linux-hardening@ to be the defacto place
for upstream Linux kernel hardening work. (And I include "upstream"
there again intentionally, and "work", which is larger than just
discussing new features.) Such a place must exist for the mechanical
and social processes inherent in the Linux kernel development model to
operate. Something needs to be listed in the MAINTAINERS file, and tools
direct email delivery much more commonly than individuals.

Since it is not part of the established Linux development processes to
_remove_ lists from CC when they're part of the maintainership chain or
git history, it's simply not possible for kernel-hardening@ to serve in
that role, given the constraints on topic applicability.

For stuff that IS a new topic, where people are explicitly choosing
what lists to send to, CCing both linux-hardening@ and kernel-hardening@
seems like the right thing to do to get that topic split.

I don't think the Linux kernel's (email) development model is compatible
with having a "strictly on-topic" mailing list as part of the standard
process. Your concerns are perfectly valid, but just not something that
I see a way to solving without significant effort (e.g. making the list
entirely moderated, etc). And moderation is actually another aspect of
the desire to move; emails are regularly auto-moderated which just
creates more manual work (for both of us).

I don't want myself or anyone else to have to worry about where the line
is drawn. If kernel-hardening@ is on CC for new topics, we're all good.
With the MAINTAINERS file updated, and a .mailmap entry added to redirect
kernel-hardening@ to linux-hardening@, all the "mechanical" threads will
avoid kernel-hardening@, and we'll be close to what will work best for
the topic split.

I understand what you mean, but I think the effort required to remove
those messages is too high. As an upstream Linux kernel maintainer, I
have different constraints on how I need a development discussion list
to operate. In the quoted thread[2] from earlier, I explained (perhaps
badly) those constraints, and you disagreed and additionally said
further discussion would hinder kernel-hardening@. It's your list and
list server, so I obviously can't make you agree to operate it the way
Linux kernel development lists are expected to work, so I didn't really
have any other choice but to start a new list. I recognize you've made a
lot of changes over the past several years (e.g. Subject prefixes, etc)
to adapt to those norms, but the list's acceptable "range of discussion"
seemed like a pretty fundamental difference that was unlikely to be
easily solved with a single list.

The better distinction is between upstream and not. Another aspect driving
this change is the belief by people that the Linux Kernel Self-Protection
Project is somehow not upstream, which I think is somewhat reinforced
by the mailing list not living on vger.kernel.org. It's hardly a strong
enough reason to move (much like the auto-moderation hassles), but when
all are combined, I found the move sufficiently justified.

Agreed, I should have said "upstream-specific" in the Subject. That was
not clear there.

Hopefully this clears things up. I'm fundamentally seeking less
work/irritation for both of us, as well as for the folks doing upstream
work who find themselves CCing a development mailing list, and the folks
who want to just see the discussion of new features.
