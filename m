Do you mean find a way to detect if this is a function return value?
Yeah, this seems like a needed step.

What were you thinking for an implementation? Universally using a local
variable doesn't gain very much (since you're just setting the local
variable NULL, not the one that lives on outside the call to kfree()).

It sounds like this may not be possible with the existing APIs -- maybe
a compiler feature is needed to do the variable tracking (and also the
"was this a function return value?" check).

This part is still worth checking: is there a real-world benefit to this
idea? (It seems like it should make some classes of UAF go away, but
it'd be nice to back this up with some "proof" from existing prior
exploits.)
