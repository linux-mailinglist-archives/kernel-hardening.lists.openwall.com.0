Right -- the manual ones might need to be split up by subsystem or
driver.

Same for this if it can't be automated.

Heh. Well, the timer_struct Cocci script was ugly too. The idea is that
maintainers will likely want per-driver patches, so the more you can
automate with a script to put in a single commit for Linus would be
better for your own sanity. :)

Probably it is only needed in the commit log.
