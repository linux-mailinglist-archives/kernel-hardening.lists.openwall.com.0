Heh, nice. That made me wonder if there was a QEmu port, but it seems
it hasn't been touched in a decade?
https://github.com/AVEx-6502/qemu-6502

Is there a particular 6502 system you're working to emulate?

Excellent! We're always glad to have folks helping.

Yeah, you'll end up uncovering some really weird stuff, as you seem to
have already found[1]. ;)

One of the double-edged swords with KSPP is while you get to work with
all the kernel's subsystem maintainers, you also have to work with all
the kernel's subsystem maintainers. ;) You'll learn a lot, but you can
also end up discovering very different requirements as you send patches.

Excellent! Yeah, it looks like you've been helping clean up some staging
drivers[2].

I see you touched rtl8192u -- there's a lot of duplicate code spread
around in the rtl* drivers. It would be interesting to see those
consolidated some day. If you're interested, it may be worth asking
about it on the wireless list.

Cool -- did anything stand out for you in those courses?

Great! One area that needs some review and testing that is x86-specific
is the userspace CET support[3]. That spans a wide range of from chipset
all the way up through compiler, kernel, and glibc. Getting more people
to try that series out and post results ("it works for me" or "I
couldn't trigger the protection", etc) would be very welcome.

You've already found the "remove the 1-element arrays" work, and there
are plenty more like that on the issue tracker. Trying to really put an
end to strlcpy[4] is ongoing[5] too, as there has been a fairly
concerted effort to remove them lately:

Count of "git grep strlcpy | wc -l" over recent releases:

         v5.17:  1535
         v5.18:  1525
         v5.19:  1507
          v6.0:  1379
        master:   544
 next-20221010:   401

Thanks for introducing yourself!
