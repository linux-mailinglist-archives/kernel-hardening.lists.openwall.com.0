This is exactly what I said. You presented me the cases which exist in
your invented world. Mentioned unhandled page fault doesn't exist in real
world. If PCI device doesn't work, it needs to be replaced/blocked and not
left to be operable and accessible from the kernel/user.

Yes, some bugs need to be fixed, but they are not related to trust/not-trust
discussion and PCI spec violations.
