Java and NodeJS can do arbitrary syscalls (through their runtime) and
they can access arbitrary files, so according to my below comment, yes
they should be managed as potentially dangerous executable code.

The question should be: is this code trusted? Most of the time it is
not, hence the security model of web browser and their heavy use of
sandboxing.  So no, I don't think it would make sense to check this kind
of code more than what the browser already do.

I'll talk about this use case in the next patch series.
