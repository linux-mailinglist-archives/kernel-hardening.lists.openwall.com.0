If my understanding is correct, TYPESAFE_BY_RCU means that the object
may be used after it has been freed, that's why we cannot further
reuse or wipe it before ensuring they aren't used anymore.
Objects allocated from normal slabs cannot be used after they've been
freed, so I don't see how this change applies to them.
