Well, not from a "number of bits available" perspective. In that case we
have plenty of bits, but we limit the size of the ID we stash to 32 bits
in all cases, so we will just end up with the 21 leading bits being
all-zero. So for those arches we basically end up in the same situation
as on 32-bit (see below).

Right, okay, I see what you mean. So the risk is basically the
following:

If some other part of the kernel ends up dereferencing the
page->lru.next pointer of a page that is owned by page_pool, and which
has an ID stashed into page->pp_magic, that dereference can end up being
to a valid userspace mapping, which can lead to Bad Things(tm), cf the
paper above.

This is mitigated by the fact that it can only happen on architectures
that don't set ILLEGAL_POINTER_VALUE (which includes 32-bit arches, and
the ones you listed above). In addition, this has to happen while the
page is owned by page_pool, and while it is DMA-mapped - we already
clear the pp_magic field when releasing the page from page_pool.

I am not sure to what extent the above is a risk we should take pains to
avoid, TBH. It seems to me that for this to become a real problem, lots
of other things will already have gone wrong. But happy to defer to the
mm/security folks here.

Given that this is all temporary until the folio rework Matthew alluded

Hmm, my thinking was that this would be a lot of irrelevant stuff to put
into poison.h, but I suppose we could do so if the mm folks don't object :)
