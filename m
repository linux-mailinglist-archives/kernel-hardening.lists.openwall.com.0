OTOH, You don't really want to blanket disable either protection, and 
unfortunately  you can't really tell until its too late if the service 
is fully BTI enabled. So you either end up disabling MDWE unnecessarily, 
or you delay until the only choice is not enabling BTI.

I guess there is another option too, which is some kind of delayed MDWE 
policy that only turns on once the service has started, but that isn't 
ideal either.
