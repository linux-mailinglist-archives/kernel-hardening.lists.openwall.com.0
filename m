Right -- I think you're both saying the same thing. Unused static
functions can be dropped (modulo a warning) in both regular and LTO
builds.

One of LTO's benefits is the performance optimizations, but that's not
the driving motivation for it here. The performance optimizations are
possible because LTO provides the compiler with a view of the entire
built-in portion of the kernel (i.e. not shared objects). That "visible
all at once" state is the central concern because CFI (Control Flow
Integrity, the driving motivation for this series) needs it in the same
way that the performance optimization passes need it.

i.e. to gain CFI coverage, LTO is required. Since LTO is a distinct
first step independent of CFI, it was split out to be upstreamed while
fixes for CFI continued to land independently[1]. Once LTO is landed,
CFI comes next.

This is just a side-effect of LTO. As Sami mentions, it's entirely
tunable, and that tuning was chosen based on measurements made for the
kernel being built with LTO[2].

It is a prerequisite for CFI, and CFI has been protecting *mumble*billion
Android device kernels against code-reuse attacks for the last 2ish
years[3]. I want this available for the entire Linux ecosystem, not just
Android; it is a strong security flaw mitigation technique.

I hope that helps explain it!
