I can imagine. Everybody would love to have a free lunch ;) But more
seriously, the overhead of the initialization is unavoidable. The memory
has to be zeroed out by definition and somebody has to pay for that.
Sure one can think of a deferred context to do that but this just
spreads  the overhead out to the overall system overhead.

Even if the zeroying is done during the allocation time then it is the
first user who can benefit from that. Any reuse of the hugetlb pool has
to reinitialize again.

One can still be creative - e.g. prefault hugetlb files from userspace
in parallel and reuse that but I am not sure kernel should try to be
clever here.
