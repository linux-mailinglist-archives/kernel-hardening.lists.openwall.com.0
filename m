Well, that really depends what would you like to achieve by this
functionality. There are likely to be all sorts of allocators on top of
the core ones (e.g. mempool allocator). The question is whether you
really want to cover them all. Are they security relevant?

Well, I would say that you have to rely on the review process here more
than any specific testing. In any case other allocators can be handled
incrementally. This is not all or nothing kinda stuff. I have pointed
out dma_pool because it only addresses one half of the work and it was
not clear why. If you want to drop dma_pool then this will be fine by
me. As this is a hardening feature you want to get coverage as large as
possible rather than 100%.
