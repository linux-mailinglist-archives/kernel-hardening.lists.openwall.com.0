That's what "unspecified" means - as far as the kernel concerned, it's
"something completely opaque, will let these hooks to play, semantics is
entirely up to them".

?????  You explicitly assume a cooperating caller.  If it can't be trusted
to issue the check between open and use, or can be manipulated (ptraced,
etc.) into not doing so, how can you rely upon the flag having been passed
in the first place?  And TOCTOU window is definitely not wider that way.

If you want to have it done immediately after open(), bloody well do it
immediately after open.  If attacker has subverted your control flow to the
extent that allows them to hit descriptor table in the interval between
these two syscalls, you have already lost - they'll simply prevent that
flag from being passed.

What's the point of burying it inside openat2()?  A convenient multiplexor
to hook into?  We already have one - it's called do_syscall_...
