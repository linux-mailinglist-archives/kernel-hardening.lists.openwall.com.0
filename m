kernstart_virt_addr is in the data section. At the early boot we only
have a 64M tlb mapping. For the 32-bit I limited the kernel in a
64M-aligned region so that we can always get kernstart_virt_addr. But
for the 64-bit the kernel is bigger and not suitable to limit it in a
64M-aligned region.

So if we use kernstart_virt_addr and the kernel is randomized like below 
, the secondary cpus will not boot up:

+------------+------------+
|  64M       |   64M      |
+------------+------------+
            ^        ^
            | kernel |
                 ^
            kernstart_virt_addr

So I have to put the kernel offset in the first 64K along with the init 
text.

It does not need to be at a fixed address. I just want to keep 
consistent and stay along with __run_at_load.

I'm not sure if relocat works for fixed symbols. I will have a test and 
swith to reference them by symbols if it works fine.

32-bit called early_get_first_memblock_info() very early which
implicitly setup the device-tree pointer.
