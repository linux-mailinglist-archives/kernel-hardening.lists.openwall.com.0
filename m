Hi there! I was trying to find a super easy way to address this, so I
thought the best thing would be if there were a compiler or linker
switch to just eliminate any duplicate symbols at compile time for
vmlinux. I filed this question on the binutils bugzilla looking to see
if there were existing flags that might do this, but H.J. Lu went ahead
and created a new one "-z unique", that seems to do what we would need
it to do. 

https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26391

When I use this option, it renames any duplicate symbols with an
extension - for example duplicatefunc.1 or duplicatefunc.2. You could
either match on the full unique name of the specific binary you are
trying to patch, or you match the base name and use the extension to
determine original position. Do you think this solution would work? If
so, I can modify livepatch to refuse to patch on duplicated symbols if
CONFIG_FG_KASLR and when this option is merged into the tool chain I
can add it to KBUILD_LDFLAGS when CONFIG_FG_KASLR and livepatching
should work in all cases.
