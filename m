This seems to be an orthogonal concern: the kernel doesn't have GCC LTO
support either (though much of Sami's work is required for GCC LTO too).

I don't know what you're defining as "real LTO", but this is, very much,
Link Time Optimization: the compiler has access to the entire code at
once, and it is therefore in a position to perform many manipulations to
the code. As Sami mentioned, perhaps you're thinking specifically of
dead code elimination? That's a specific optimization.

Which LTO passes are happening, how optimization are being performed,
etc, are endlessly tunable, but we can't work on that tuning without
the infrastructure to perform an LTO build in the first place. We need
to land the support, and go from there. As written, it works very well
for arm64 (which is what v8 targets specifically) and the results have
been running on millions of Android phones for years now. If further
tuning needs to happen for other architectures, config combinations, etc,
those can and will be developed. (For example, x86 is around the corner,
once some false positive warnings from objtool get hammered out, etc.)

I still want this in -next so we can build on it and improve it -- it
has been stuck in limbo for too long.
