I have. And many other people have. People who have creating user
namespaces by unpriviliged user disabled. I find it sad that we have no
tool in mainline kernel to limit users access to creating user
namespaces except complete disabling them. But many distros have that
tools. Different tools with different interfaces and semantics :(

And at least one major GNU/Linux distro disabled idmapped mounts
unconditionally. If I were the author of this functionality, I would
prefer to have a knob then have it unavailible for for so many users. But a=
s you wish.
