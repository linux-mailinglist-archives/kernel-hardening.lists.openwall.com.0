Hi all,
We are really thankful for all the suggestions and concerns. We are 
definitely interested in continuing this line of research.

Just to clarify:Â  SyzScope is an ongoing research project that is 
currently under submission, which has an anonymity requirement. 
Therefore we chose to use a gmail address initially in the public 
channel. Since Greg asked, we did reveal our university affiliation and 
email address, as well as cross-referenced a private email (again using 
university address) to security@kernel.org. We are sorry for the chaos 
of using several different email addresses. In the future, we will try 
to use our university address directly (we checked with other 
researchers and it seems to be okay).
