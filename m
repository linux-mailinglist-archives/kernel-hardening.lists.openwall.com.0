So, I'm caught in a tight spot between Linus's deprecation of BUG()[1],
and the desire for high-sensitivity security-oriented system builders
to have a "completely stop running that kernel thread" option. Linus's
entirely reasonable observation that BUG() destabilizes the kernel more
often than it doesn't means there isn't actually a safe "stop that kernel
thread" option, especially since many mitigations that detect badness span
a spectrum of "stops the badness before it happens" (e.g. NX memory) to
"I see badness has already happened" (e.g. stack protector). As a result,
the only way to provide a way for the security-prioritized users is to
downgrade corruptions to DoSes via panic(). I wish there was a magic
way to have a perfect kernel state unwinder to get us the BUG() we
wanted it to be, but given the kernel's complexity, it doesn't exist
(and is unlikely to be worth developing). Right now, we either get
"WARN() and keep going as best we can" or we get "WARN() and panic".

And with regard to "WARNs should be safe to add", yes, that's generally
true, but the goal is to not make them reachable from userspace because
of this need to be able to "upgrade" them to panic(). I have tried to
document[1] this:

  Note that the WARN()-family should only be used for "expected to
  be unreachable" situations. If you want to warn about "reachable
  but undesirable" situations, please use the pr_warn()-family of
  functions. System owners may have set the *panic_on_warn* sysctl,
  to make sure their systems do not continue running in the face of
  "unreachable" conditions. (For example, see commits like `this one
  <https://git.kernel.org/linus/d4689846881d160a4d12a514e991a740bcb5d65a>`_.)

I understand your general objection to non-deterministic defenses,
as there will always be ways to weaken them, but I don't think that's
reason enough to not have them. I prefer to look at mitigations as a
spectrum, and to recognize that some are more effective with certain
system configurations. They become tools to choose from when building
defense in depth.

Totally agreed about that. Ubuntu may be hard to convince as one of
their design principles has been to make the first user able to use the
system completely with as little interruption as possible. (e.g. pop-up
confirmation dialogs are strongly discouraged, etc.)

So, for this series, I think the benefit-to-complexity value is high.
It's a simple solution even if it's not perfect (most things can't be
given the existing kernel design trade-offs).
