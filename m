You just now broke any normal user programs that required this (or the
other ioctls), and so you are going to have to force them to be run with
CAP_SYS_ADMIN permissions?  That feels like you are going backwards in
security, not forwards.

And you didn't change anything for programs like gpm that already had
root permission (and shouldn't that permission be dropped anyway?)
