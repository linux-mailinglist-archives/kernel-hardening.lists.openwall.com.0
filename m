I'm not sure about the O_DENY_WRITE approach, but the problem is worth solv=
ing.

AT_EXECVE_CHECK is not just for scripting languages. It could also
work with bytecodes like Java, for example. If we let the Java runtime
call AT_EXECVE_CHECK before loading the bytecode, the LSM could
develop a policy based on that.

Agree, the race problem needs to be solved in order for AT_EXECVE_CHECK.

Enforcing non-write for the path that stores scripts or bytecodes can
be challenging due to historical or backward compatibility reasons.
Since AT_EXECVE_CHECK provides a mechanism to check the file right
before it is used, we can assume it will detect any "problem" that
happened before that, (e.g. the file was overwritten). However, that
also imposes two additional requirements:
1> the file doesn't change while AT_EXECVE_CHECK does the check.
2>The file content kept by the process remains unchanged after passing
the AT_EXECVE_CHECK.

I imagine, the complete solution for AT_EXECVE_CHECK would include
those two grantees.

Thanks
