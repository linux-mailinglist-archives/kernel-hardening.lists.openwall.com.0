BTW, there might be other users for something like __GFP_DONT_ZERO.

Especially, memory ballooning drivers (and virtio-mem), whereby the
hypervisor is (WHP) going to zap the page either way after allocation.
You just cannot assume that when freeing such a page again, that it's
actually zero.

But then, somebody told the system to suffer ("alloc_on_init"), so there
isn't too much motivation to optimize such corner cases.
