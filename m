I'm not sure if always storing the base address in thread_info would
simplify the code that much. We could remove __scs_base() and
scs_task_reset(), which are both trivial, and drop a few instructions
in the arch-specific code that clear the field. I do agree that a
comment or two would help understand what's going on here though.
