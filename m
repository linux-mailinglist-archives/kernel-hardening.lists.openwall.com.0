My assumption is that the dynamic linker may become smarter and detect
BTI issues, if necessary.

Let's say we link together multiple objects, some of them with BTI
instructions, others without. Does the static linker generate a
.note.gnu.property section with GNU_PROPERTY_AARCH64_FEATURE_1_BTI? I
guess not, otherwise the .text section would have a mixture of functions
with and without landing pads.

In the dynamic linker case, if there are multiple shared objects where
some are missing BTI, I guess the dynamic linker currently invokes
mprotect(PROT_BTI) (or mmap()) on all objects with the corresponding
GNU_PROPERTY.

While I don't immediately see an issue with the dynamic loader always
turning on PROT_BTI based solely on the shared object it is linking in,
the static linker takes a more conservative approach. The dynamic linker
may not have a similar choice in the future if the kernel forced
PROT_BTI on the main executable. In both cases it was a user choice.

The dynamic loader itself is statically linked, so any potential
mismatch would have been detected at build time and the corresponding
GNU_PROPERTY unset.

For static exe, we assume that the compatibility was checked at link
time. However, you are right on the vdso, we always turn BTI on. So it
can indeed be argued that the kernel already made the decision for (some
of) the user modules.

We currently left this policy decision to the dynamic loader (mostly,
apart from vdso).

If we (kernel people) agree to set PROT_BTI on for the main executable,
we can expose a bit (in AT_FLAGS or somewhere) to tell the dynamic
loader that PROT_BTI is already on. I presume subsequent objects will be
mapped with mmap().

I think ignoring the mprotect() error is the best we can do now. If we
add a kernel patch to turn PROT_BTI on together with an AT_FLAGS bit,
the user mprotect() would no longer be necessary.

In the absence of an AT_FLAGS bit, we could add PROT_BTI on the main exe
and backport the fix to when we first added BTI support. This way the
dynamic loader may just ignore the mprotect() altogether on the main
exe, assuming that people run latest stable kernels.

Unfortunately, I think you are right here.

Anyway, looking for any other input from the kernel and systemd people.
If not, I'll post a patch at 5.11-rc1 turning PROT_BTI on for the main
exe and take it from there. I think such discussion shouldn't disrupt
the glibc fixes/improvements.
