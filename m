Incidentally, I've worked on changing the way we handle warnings over
the past week, going through all ~700 warning options supported by
either clang or gcc to figure out how many instances we get and if
we are missing any important ones.

https://pastebin.com/wqG9QgHj has a list of the warnings that exist,
when they got added and how many I saw. I'll post this as proper
patches when I have integrated this into the build system better.

the only warning I see here is "warning: format not a string literal and
no format arguments", this seems useful at the W=1 or W=2
level, but I can't even think of how to change the compiler to
turn this on by default.

I have the suspicion that this would actually find some serious bugs,
but I also share your view that this is near-impossible to fix
throughout the kernel.

My experiments show around 3000 files that cause this warning,
though fixing the ones in shared header files would get us closer
to enabling it at W=1. Most of the output from this seems to be from
two header files.

This one could be enabled by default and then disabled locally
in functions that are known to be safe.

In the current kernel, I see only around 100 files that produce this warning,
so this one is definitely in reach.

With the patch series I'm working on, we will be able to control the warning
level (W=1, W=12 etc) per file and per subsystem, which I hope should make
it easier to attack some of the hard problems by fixing a whole class
of warnings one subsystem at a time.
