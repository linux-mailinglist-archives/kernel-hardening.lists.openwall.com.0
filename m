You can do exactly the same thing if you do the check in a separate
syscall though.

And it provides a greater degree of flexibility; for example, you can
use it in combination with fopen() without having to modify the
internals of fopen() or having to use fdopen().

The assumption that security checks should happen as early as possible
can actually cause security problems. For example, because seccomp was
designed to do its checks as early as possible, including before
ptrace, we had an issue for a long time where the ptrace API could be
abused to bypass seccomp filters.

Please don't decide that a check must be ordered first _just_ because
it is a security check. While that can be good for limiting attack
surface, it can also create issues when the idea is applied too
broadly.

I don't see how TOCTOU issues are relevant in any way here. If someone
can turn a script that is considered a trusted file into an untrusted
file and then maliciously change its contents, you're going to have
issues either way because the modifications could still happen after
openat(); if this was possible, the whole thing would kind of fall
apart. And if that isn't possible, I don't see any TOCTOU.

It actually provides a superset of the functionality that your
existing patches provide.
