So I have a naive fix for kexec which has only been tested to work under KVM.
When tested on a physical host, it did not boot when SMAP or UMIP were set.
Undoubtedly it's not the correct way to do this, as it skips CPU feature
identification, opting instead for blindly setting the bits. The physical host
I tested this on does not have UMIP so that's likely why it failed to boot when
UMIP gets set blindly. Within kvm-unit-tests, the test for SMAP maps memory as
supervisor pages before enabling SMAP. I suspect this is why setting SMAP
blindly causes the physical host not to boot.

Within trampoline_32bit_src() if I add more instructions I get an error
about "attempt to move .org backwards", which as I understand it means
there are only so many instructions allowed in each of those functions.

My suspicion is that someone with more knowledge of this area has a good
idea on how best to handle this. Feedback would be much appreciated.

TL;DR We probably shouldn't use the switch to real mode as a trigger to drop
pinning.

This protection assumes that the attacker is at the point where they have the
ability to write a payload for a ROP/JOP attack and gain control of execution.

For this case where we are going to switch to real mode we need to add an
assumption that the attacker has a write primitive that allows them to write
part of their payload to memory that will be addressable within 16 bit mode.

If the attacker has this write primitive, the attack becomes write payloads,
within the first stage, switch to real mode, use stage two within real mode via
JOP or just machine code (since there's we don't have to worry NX) to setup
protected mode and jump back into the kernel with protections disabled.

In the next version of this patchset I've made it so that the default allowed
values are WP, SMEP, SMAP, and UMIP. However, a write to the allowed MSR from
the host VMM (QEMU) can change which bits are allowed.
