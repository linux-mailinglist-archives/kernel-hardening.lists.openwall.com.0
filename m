Really? How does that work when a kernel update needs to add elements
to existing structs that are part of that "ABI"? Especially when those
structs have something at the end that's variable-length (like
task_struct) or they're embedded in something else?

Maybe you should've done something like BPF's CORE if you really want
to do something like that, teaching the compiler to generate
relocations for struct offsets...

Let's assume that at a later point, someone wants to track for each
process how many UBSAN errors that process has seen so far. And maybe
at that point, we have error recovery support in trap mode. So that
person sends a patch that, among other things, adds something like
this to task_struct:

    #ifdef CONFIG_UBSAN
    unsigned int ubsan_errors_seen;
    #endif

If that patch lands, ABI compatibility between UBSAN=y&&UBSAN_TRAP=y
and UBSAN=n will break again.


I believe that it should normally be possible to add stuff like

    #ifdef CONFIG_<something>
    <some field declaration>
    #endif

to an existing kernel struct without breaking anything (outside UAPI
headers and such). Your patch assumes that that won't happen for
CONFIG_UBSAN.

Yeah, but I think that that's still cleaner than assuming that some
normal kernel flag won't change struct layouts...

Anyway, the diff itself looks reasonable to me (although I dislike the
commit message), but don't be surprised if this "ABI" is broken again
in the future.
