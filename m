As I mentioned we are willing to collaborate but the current landlock
patches does not meet the needs for KRSI:

* One program type per use-case (eg. LANDLOCK_PROG_PTRACE) as opposed to
  a single program type. This is something that KRSI proposed in it's
  initial design [1] and the new common "eBPF + LSM" based approach
  [2] would maintain as well.

* Landlock chooses to have multiple LSM hooks per landlock hook which is
  more restrictive. It's not easy to write precise MAC and Audit
  policies for a privileged LSM based on this and this ends up bloating
  the context that needs to be maintained and requires avoidable
  boilerplate work in the kernel.
