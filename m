Individual LSMs may implement mandatory access control models, but
that is not an inherent requirement imposed by the LSM layer.  While
the Landlock LSM does not (yet?) support access controls for abstract
sockets, it is a discretionary access control mechanism.

I'm not currently aware of a discretionary access control LSM that
supports abstract socket access control, but such a LSM should be
possible if someone wanted to implement one.
