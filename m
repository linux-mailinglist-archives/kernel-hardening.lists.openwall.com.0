I don't get what you want to prove. Please read carefully the cover
letter, the use case and the threat model.

The execute permission (like the write permission) does not only depends
on the permission set on files, but it also depends on the
options/permission of their mount points, the MAC policy, etc. The
initial use case to enforce O_MAYEXEC is to rely on the noexec mount option.

If you want a consistent policy, you need to make one. Only dealing with
file properties may not be enough. This is explain in the cover letter
and the patches. If you allow all users to write and execute their
files, then there is no point in enforcing anything with O_MAYEXEC.

It said "the mount points or the file access rights". Please take a look
at the documentation patch.

A consistent policy. Please take a look at the documentation patch which
explains the remaining prerequisites. You can also take a look at the
talks for further details.

It is a summary. Can you please suggest something better?
