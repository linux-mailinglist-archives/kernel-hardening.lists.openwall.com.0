A little background, this was originally introduced in 2008:

 5e3ca0ec76fce ("ftrace: introduce the "hex" output method")

And commit ad0a3b68114e8 ("trace: add build-time check to avoid overrunning hex buffer")

changed HEX_CHARS from a hardcoded 17 to a way to decided what the max
long is.

 #define HEX_CHARS              (MAX_MEMHEX_BYTES*2 + 1)

Note, it only does that for little endian machines.

So the bug looks like it was there since the original code was
introduced in 2008! There's two variables being increased in that loop
(i and j), and i follows the raw data, and j follows what is being
written into the buffer. The bug is that we are comparing the HEX_CHARS
to 'i' when we really should be comparing it to 'j'! As if 'j' goes
bigger than HEX_CHARS, it will overflow the destination buffer.

And, it should be noted, that this is to read a single word (long) and
not more. Thus, the "date += start_len" shouldn't be needed.

Could you send another patch that makes it only process a single word
and exit?

I'll tag it for stable when you do.

Thanks!
