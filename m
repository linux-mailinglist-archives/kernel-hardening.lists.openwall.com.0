A comment isn't going to really help fix this (much of the CCing is done
by scripts, etc).

I've tended to prefer more emails than missing discussions, and I think
it's not unreasonable to have the list mentioned in MAINTAINERS for
those things. It does, of course, mean that "maintenance" patches get
directed there too, as you say.

If it's really something you'd like to avoid, I can drop those
references. My instinct is to leave it as-is, but the strength of my
opinion is pretty small. Let me know what you prefer...
