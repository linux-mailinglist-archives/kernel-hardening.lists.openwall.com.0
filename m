This patch is missing context. What, at a high level, is your goal
with this patch? My guess is that you're trying to close gaps in the
protection that SELinux provides with "execmod" rules, and that you
want to ensure that an attacker who is exploiting a memory corruption
bug still can't modify machine code in the process being exploited.

You should CC appropriate kernel developers and lists for the code
you're modifying; see Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst,
section "5) Select the recipients for your patch".

I think you're putting your checks in the wrong place.
If you put security checks into architecture-specific parts of the
codebase, then someone who wants to modify those checks might only
change some of the copies; and then the security checks become
inconsistent across architectures.
But also, there is already a function parameter at a higher level that
controls this behavior: In fs/proc/base.c, the function mem_rw() calls
access_remote_vm() with the flag FOLL_FORCE, which controls whether
overwriting non-writable memory is allowed. If you want to prevent the
use of /proc/*/mem to overwrite non-writable memory, then you can just
make it configurable whether that flag is used in that function.

Why this "depends on" rule? CONFIG_CROSS_MEMORY_ATTACH only controls
the process_vm_readv() and process_vm_writev() syscalls, and those
can't modify read-only memory because process_vm_rw_single_vec()
doesn't set FOLL_FORCE.

Also, I think the CONFIG_ prefix shouldn't be used inside Kconfig.

You are introducing a kernel config flag, but no corresponding sysctl,
which means that changing the flag requires recompiling the kernel.
If your intent really is to strengthen SELinux execmod rules as I
guessed, then you could also perform a check against the SELinux
context of the tracer in mem_open(), or something like that - then you
might not need to make this configurable via kconfig anymore.
