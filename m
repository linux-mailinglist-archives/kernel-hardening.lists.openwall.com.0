My complaint about moderation is about the list needing to be moderated
at all. (I would note that your own postings to kernel-hardening@ got
moderated...) While vger is certainly not perfect in its spam control,
it is usually fine, and behaves well enough for many other upstream
kernel lists.

My expectation would be that "new topic" RFCs/patches would be CCed to
both lists. Everything else would go to linux-hardening.

These threads are all on topic, as far as I'm concerned, but they easily
run the "risk" of turning into bike-shedding and nuance, etc. But those
are exactly the kinds of threads I want to have on linux-hardening@ (as
well as the "larger" topics).

Right -- and this is impossible to separate "by default" without a second
list. linux-hardening@ is the default now, as declared by MAINTAINERS
and mailmap. For folks wanting a wider audience for new/big topics,
kernel-hardening@ can be additionally CCed. I have clarified this in the
KSPP wiki now:

Agreed.
