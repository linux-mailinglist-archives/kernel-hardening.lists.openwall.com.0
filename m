If I understood correctly, Andrew suggested to add such macros in kernel.h
https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2019/06/11/5

Moreover similar type of other macros (like typeof_member & ARRAY_SIZE)
are defined in kernel.h
But as you pointed out, looks like stddef.h is the right place for this macro.

I went through your tree.

Thank you for reordering the patches.

Thanks,
