See this asked a lot, and as someone who works mostly in languages with rob=
ust test facilities, I gotta ask: why isn't kernel code mandated to be subm=
itted with tests?

The maple tree thing was kind of a mess and was a much bigger change than =
the stuff people push in these security machinations=2E With the pushback u=
pstream gives on this stuff its no wonder that actual progress on kernsec i=
s made by an out of tree third party=2E Upstream does not make it easy to i=
mprove boundaries and controls or establish coherent awareness=2E

Introducing tests and a public, expandable, well-defined threat model agai=
nst which defensive measures are built would permit smaller/piecemeal effor=
ts to cobble together a stronger overall posture (and automate regression t=
esting for new features which are not necessarily seen as being in the secu=
rity domain)=2E
