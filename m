Let me understand this. You are saying that the trampoline code
would raise a signal and, in the signal handler, set up the context
so that when the signal handler returns, we end up in the target
function with the context correctly set up. And, this trampoline code
can be generated statically at build time so that there are no
security issues using it.

Have I understood your suggestion correctly?

So, my argument would be that this would always incur the overhead
of a trip to the kernel. I think twice the overhead if I am not mistaken.
With trampfd, we can have the kernel generate the code so that there
is no performance penalty at all.

Signals have many problems. Which signal number should we use for this
purpose? If we use an existing one, that might conflict with what the application
is already handling. Getting a new signal number for this could meet
with resistance from the community.

Also, signals are asynchronous. So, they are vulnerable to race conditions.
To prevent other signals from coming in while handling the raised signal,
we would need to block and unblock signals. This will cause more
overhead.

How is this better than the kernel handling an address fault?
The system call still needs to do the same work as the fault handler.
We do need to specify the register and stack contexts before hand
so the system call can do its job.

Also, this always incurs a trip to the kernel. With trampfd, the kernel
could generate the code to avoid the performance penalty.

I need to study unwinders a little before I respond to this question.
So, bear with me.

I am thinking that the trampfd API can be used for addressing JIT
code as well. I have not yet started thinking about the details. But I
think the API is sufficient. E.g.,

    struct trampfd_jit {
        void    *source;
        size_t    len;
    };

    struct trampfd_jit    jit;
    struct trampfd_map    map;
    void    *addr;

    jit.source = blah;
    jit.size = blah;

    fd = syscall(440, TRAMPFD_JIT, &jit, flags);
    pread(fd, &map, sizeof(map), TRAMPFD_MAP_OFFSET);
    addr = mmap(NULL, map.size, map.prot, map.flags, fd, map.offset);

And addr would be used to invoke the generated JIT code.
