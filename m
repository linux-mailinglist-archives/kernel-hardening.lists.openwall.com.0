Not really, we have to differentiate char, short, int and long long.

First, since you found a real bug, we need to just fix that first (single
word as is done currently). Because this needs to go to stable, and what
you are explaining above is an enhancement, and not something that needs to
be backported.

Second, is there a use case? Honestly, I never use the "hex" version of the
output. That was only pulled in because it was implemented in the original
code that was in the rt patch. I wish we could just get rid of it.

Thus, if there's a use case for handling more than one word, then I'm fine
with adding that enhancement. But if it is being done just because it can
be, then I don't think we should bother.

What use case do you have in mind?

Anyway, please send just a fix patch, and then we can discuss the merits of
this update later. I'd like the fix to be in ASAP.

Thanks!
