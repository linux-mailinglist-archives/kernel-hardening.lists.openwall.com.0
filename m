That covers the hyp->guest->hyp round trip, but not the host->hyp->host
portion surrounding that.

Anywhere we use __call_hyp() expects x18 to be preserved across the
call, and that's not only used to enter the guest. If we don't want to
do that naturally at EL2, we'd probably have to add that to
do_el2_call in arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/hyp-entry.S.

Thanks,
Mark.
