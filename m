Not just that, also because it can and does emulate some devices.
For example, are disk encryption systems protected against timing of
disk accesses?
This is why some people keep saying "forget about emulated devices, require
passthrough, include devices in the trust zone".

Host.  Lots of existing systems do this.  As an extreme boot a RO disk,
limit which packages are allowed.
