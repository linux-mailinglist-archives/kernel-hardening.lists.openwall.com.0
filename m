If you mean make them such that kernel testing systems could simply
take the first line as "crash identity", then most likely we need
function name there instead of file:line:column. At least this seems
to be working the best based on our experience.

There are test inputs, each also contains expected parsing output
(title at minimum, but can also contain crash type, corrupted mark,
extracted "report") and that's verified against actual parsing result.

Unfortunately all of kernel tooling is completely untested at the
moment. We would very much like to have all sanitizers tested in a
meaningful way, e.g.:
https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/master/test/asan/TestCases/global-overflow.cpp#L15-L18
But also LOCKDEP, KMEMLEAK, ODEBUG, FAULT_INJECTS, etc, all untested
too. Nobody knows what they produce, and if they even still detect
bugs, report false positives, etc.
But that's the kernel testing story...

No, syzbot does not do kernels unit-testing. And there are no such
tests anyways...
