I remember a conversation with some of our database people who thought
it best for their model if hugetlb pages in the pool were already clear
so that no initialization was done at fault time.  Of course, this requires
clearing at page free time.  In their model, they thought it better to pay
the price at allocation (pool creation) time and free time so that faults
would be as fast as possible.

I wonder if the VMs backed by hugetlbfs pages would benefit from this
behavior as well?

If we track the initialized state (clean or not) of huge pages in the
pool as suggested in Michal's skeleton of a patch, we 'could' then allow
users to choose when hugetlb page clearing is done.

None of that would address the original point of this thread, the global
init_on_alloc parameter.
