You're talking about the author of the allegations being involved in
disabling idmapped mounts for rhel under [2] as I was told.
 
If a downstream distro wants to disable this feature based on
allegations we've refuted multiple times then we can't stop them from
doing so.

The only disconcerting thing is that this helps spreads misinformation
as evidenced by this patch. The allegations and refutation around them
are all visible and I've linked to them in the initial reply.

This is a root-only accessible feature with a massive testsuite and
being used for 2 years. Each bug fixed gets its own regression test
right away. We will of course take and upstream patches that fix actual
clearly reported bugs.
 
In the end it is not different from say Archlinux [1] having had user
namespaces disabled for 5+ years from their introduction in 2013
onwards and many other examples. Downstream distros can make whatever
choice they want and diverge from upstream.
 
In any case, I'll be on vacation for about 2 weeks with very limited
access to internet going forward.
