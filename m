I write in C because doing register tracking is hard :-)
I've got an hdlc implementation in C that is carefully adjusted
so that the worst case path is bounded.
I probably know every one of the 1000 instructions in it.

Would an asm statement that uses the same 'register' for input and
output but doesn't actually do anything help?
It won't generate any code, but the compiler ought to assume that
it might change the value - so can't do optimisations that track
the value across the call.

I'm fed up of gcc generating the code that uses SIMD instructions
for the 'tail' loop at the end of a function that is already doing
SIMD operations for the main part of the loop.
And compilers that convert a byte copy loop to 'rep movsb'.
If I'm copying 3 or 4 bytes I don't want a 40 clock overhead.
