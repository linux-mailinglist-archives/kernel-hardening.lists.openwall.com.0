Hi Mingo, thanks for taking a look, I am glad you like the idea. Some

So my strategy so far was to try to get a very basic non-performance
optimized fgkaslr mode merged first, then add performance optimized
options as a next step. For example, a user might pass in
fgkaslr="group" to the fgkaslr kernel parameter to select a layout
which groups some things by whatever criteria we want to mitigate some
of the performance impact of full randomization, or they might chose
fgkaslr="full", which just randomizes everything (the current
implementation). If people think it's worth adding the performance
optimizations for the initial merge, I can certainly work on those, but
i thought it might be better to keep it super simple at first.

We talked during the RFC stage of porting the chacha20 code to this
early boot stage to use as a prand generator. Ultimately, this means
you now have a secret you have to protect (the seed), and so I've
dropped this for now. I could see maybe having this as a debug option?
I certainly use a prand myself even now when I'm still debugging
functional issues (although the one I use for my own debugging isn't
suitable for merging).

By raw kernel image, do you mean just what eventually gets copied into
memory after decompression minus the relocation table? If so, this is
almost no difference - the only difference is that there is a little
bit of change in the padding between sections vs what the non-
randomized kernel is because of alignment differences with the new
layout. so you wind up with a few extra bytes give or take.

Most of the changes outside of fgkaslr.c, module.c, and kallsyms.c were
little tweaks here and there to accommodate using -ffunction-sections
and handling >64K elf sections, otherwise yes, I tried to keep it very
self contained and non-invasive.
