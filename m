As ask in my previous email [1], I don't see how KRSI would efficiently
deal with other LSM hooks with a unique program (attach) type.

Why do you think it is more restrictive or it adds boilerplate work? How
does KRSI will deal with more complex hooks than execve-like with
multiple kernel objects?
