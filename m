KFENCE also has to ignore both TYPESAFE_BY_RCU and ctors.
For ctors it should be pretty straightforward to fix (and won't
require any changes to SL[AU]B). Not sure if your proposal for RCU
will also work for KFENCE.

Another beneficiary of RCU/ctor normalization would be
init_on_alloc/init_on_free, which also ignore such slabs.
