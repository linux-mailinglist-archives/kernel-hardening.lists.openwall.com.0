Well, as said before, (full/original/system-wide) W^X may require
trampfd (as well as other building-blocks).

I guess most Linux deployments are not on "generic systems"
anyway (even if they may be based on generic distros), and W^X
contradicts the fact that users/attackers can do whatever they want on
the system.

No one talked about a single-purpose system.

Not necessarily with the patch series I pointed out just before.

System-wide W^X is not only for memory, and as Madhavan said: "this RFC
pertains to converting dynamic [writable] machine code to static
[non-writable] code".

Are you proposing to add a
"[feature-not-useful-without-a-proper-system-configuration]" tag in
subjects? :)
