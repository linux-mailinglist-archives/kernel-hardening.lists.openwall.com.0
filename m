With my other hat as a representative of hardware vendor (at least for
NIC part), who cares about quality of our devices, we don't want to hide
ANY crash related to our devices, especially if it is related to misbehaving
PCI HW logic. Any uncontrolled "robustness" hides real issues and makes
QA/customer support much harder.
