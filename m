Hi,

first of all, thanks to everyone here for this awesome project and the work=
 you do.

Personally I am interested in Linux Kernel Security and especially features=
 supporting attack surface reduction. In the past I did some work on sandbo=
xing features like seccomp support in user space applications. I have been =
rather hesitant to get involved here, since I am not a full time developer =
and certainly not an expert in C programming.=20

However I am currently doing a research project that aims to identify risk =
areas in the kernel by measuring code complexity metrics and assuming this =
might help this project, I would like to ask for some feedback in case this=
 work can actually help with this project.

My approach is basically to take a look at the different system calls and m=
easure the complexity of the code involved in their execution. Since code c=
omplexity has already been found to have a strong correlation with the prob=
ability of existing vulnerabilities, this might indicate kernel areas that =
need a closer look.
Additionally the functionality of the syscall will also be considered for a=
 final risk score, although most of the work for this part has already been=
 done in [1].
The objective is to create a risk score matrix for linux syscalls that cons=
ists of the functionality risk according to [1], times the measured complex=
ity.
This will (hopefully) be helpful to identify risk areas in the kernel and p=
rovide user space developers with an measurement that can help design secur=
e software and sandboxing features.  =20


One major aspect I am still not sure about is the challenges regarding the =
dynamic measure of code path execution. While it is possible to measure the=
 cyclomatic complexity of the kernel code with existing tools, I am not sur=
e how much value the results would have, given that this does not include t=
he dynamic code path behind each syscall. I was thinking of using ftrace to=
 follow and measure the execution path. Any feedback and advise on this for=
 this would be appreciated.
