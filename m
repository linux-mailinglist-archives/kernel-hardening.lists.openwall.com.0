Like Jann said, syscalls is generally _not_ at the correct level to do
something like this.

Consider a single 'read' syscall of 1 byte out of a file.  Should be
pretty trivial, as that read could be on a sysfs file that merely
returns a single value that is stored in kernel memory for a
configuration option.  That's a simple thing, so all is good, right?

But what about sysfs files that change kernel state when you read a
value, depending on the file, that sometimes is the case, right?

Then think about if you read 1 byte on a filesystem, that is a NFS
mounted filesystem over a PPP networking connection on that is connected
on a USB-serial device to the system.  The number of layers involved
here are very very non-trivial, but yet, that was the same single byte
being read in a syscall.

There's loads of "state" in a kernel system for the configuration of the
system and hardware (oh yeah, you need to think about what the hardware
state is, what hardware involved is and the like.

Good luck!
