For libffi, I think the proposed standard trampoline won't actually
work, because not all ABIs have two scratch registers available to use
as code_reg and data_reg. Eg i386 fastcall only has one, and register
has zero scratch registers. I believe 32-bit ARM only has one scratch
register as well.

For i386 you'd need something that saves a register on the stack first,
maybe like the below with a 16-byte trampoline and a 16-byte context
structure that has the address of the code to jump to in the first
dword:

	.balign 4096
	trampoline_page:

	.rept	4096/16-1
	0:	endbr32
		push	%eax
		call	__x86.get_pc_thunk.ax
	1:	jmp	trampoline
	.balign 16
	.endr

	.org trampoline_page + 4096 - 16
	__x86.get_pc_thunk.ax:
		movl	(%esp), %eax
		ret
	trampoline:
		subl	$(1b-0b), %eax
		jmp	*(table-trampoline_page)(%eax)

	.org trampoline_page + 4096
	table:
