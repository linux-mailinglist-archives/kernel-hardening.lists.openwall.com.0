Right and BPF is the only thing that exists in the kernel where the verifier
knows precisely the number of instructions the critical path through the
program will take. Currently we don't quantify this cost for bpf helpers, but
it's easy to add. Can you do this for smack? Can you tell upfront the longest
execution time for all security rules?

I'm not sure why you got such impression. I'm not proposing to refactor vfs or
add fields to skb. Once we have equivalent to smack policy implemented in
bpf-based lsm let's do performance benchmarking and compare actual numbers
instead of hypothesizing about them. Which policy do you think would be
the most representative of smack use case?

Are you talking about inode->i_security ? That's not manipulating inode data.
It's attaching extra metadata to inode object without changing inode itself.
BPF can do it already via hash maps. It's not as fast as direct pointer access,
but for many use cases it's good enough. If it turns out to be a performance
limiting factor we will accelerate it.

It sounds to me that some folks in the community got wrong impression that
anything that BPF accesses is magically turning that thing into stable kernel
ABI. That is not true. BPF progs had access _all_ kernel data pointers and
structures for years without turning the whole kernel into stable ABI. I want
to make sure that this part is understood. This is also a requirement for
bpf-based LSM. It must not make LSM hooks into stable ABI.
