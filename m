Hi Jann,

Both things sound good to me. I think we considered doing the ctor's
change with KASAN, but we did not get anywhere. The only argument
against it I remember now was "performance", but it's not that
important if this mode is enabled only with KASAN and other debugging
tools. Performance is definitely not as important as missing bugs. The
additional code complexity for ctors change should be minimal.
The rcu change would also be useful, but I would assume it will be larger.
Please add them to [1], that's KASAN laundry list.

+Alex, Marco, will it be useful for KFENCE [2] as well? Do ctors/rcu
affect KFENCE? Will we need any special handling for KFENCE?
I assume it will also be useful for KMSAN b/c we can re-mark objects
as uninitialized only after they have been reallocated.
