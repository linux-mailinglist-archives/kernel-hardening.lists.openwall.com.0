Namespacing at OSI4 seems a bit fraught as the underlying route, mac, and p=
hysdev fall outside the callers control=2E Multiple NS' sharing an IP stack=
 would exhaust ephemeral ranges faster (likely asymmetrically too) and have=
 bound socket collisions opaque to each other requiring handling outside th=
