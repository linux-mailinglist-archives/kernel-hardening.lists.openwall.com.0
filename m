Ok. I suspect I also won't get the chance to test that in the next few
days, but if I do I'll try to share the results.

My concern here was that, get_random_int() has to grab a spinlock and
mess with IRQ masking, so has the potential to block for much longer,
but that might not be an issue in practice, and I don't think that
should block these patches.

AArch64 doesn't have a direct equivalent. The generic counter
(CNTxCT_EL0) is the closest thing, but its nominal frequency is
typically much lower than the nominal CPU clock frequency (unlike TSC
where they're the same). The cycle counter (PMCCNTR_EL0) is part of the
PMU, and can't be relied on in the same way (e.g. as perf reprograms it
to generate overflow events, and it can stop for things like WFI/WFE).

Thanks,
Mark.
