At boot time, find all the function sections that have separate .text
sections, shuffle them, and then copy them to new locations. Adjust
any relocations accordingly.

+=====================================================================
+Function Granular Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (fgkaslr)
+=====================================================================
+
+:Date: 6 April 2020
+:Author: Kristen Accardi
+
+Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) was merged into the kernel
+with the objective of increasing the difficulty of code reuse attacks. Code
+reuse attacks reused existing code snippets to get around existing memory
+protections. They exploit software bugs which expose addresses of useful code
+snippets to control the flow of execution for their own nefarious purposes.
+KASLR as it was originally implemented moves the entire kernel code text as a
+unit at boot time in order to make addresses less predictable. The order of the
+code within the segment is unchanged - only the base address is shifted. There
+are a few shortcomings to this algorithm.
+
+1. Low Entropy - there are only so many locations the kernel can fit in. This
+   means an attacker could guess without too much trouble.
+2. Knowledge of a single address can reveal the offset of the base address,
+   exposing all other locations for a published/known kernel image.
+3. Info leaks abound.
+
+Finer grained ASLR has been proposed as a way to make ASLR more resistant
+to info leaks. It is not a new concept at all, and there are many variations
+possible. Function reordering is an implementation of finer grained ASLR
+which randomizes the layout of an address space on a function level
+granularity. We use the term "fgkaslr" in this document to refer to the
+technique of function reordering when used with KASLR, as well as finer grained
+KASLR in general.
+
+Implementation Details
+======================
+
+The over-arching objective of the fgkaslr implementation is incremental
+improvement over what we already have, as well as something that can be
+merged and deployed with as little disruption to our existing kernel/ecosystem
+as possible. It is designed to work with the existing solution, and there are
+two main area where code changes occur: Build time, and Load time.
+
+Build time
+----------
+
+GCC has an option to place functions into individual .text sections. We can
+use this option to implement function reordering at load time. The final
+compiled vmlinux retains all the section headers, which can be used to help
+us find the address ranges of each function. Using this information and
+an expanded table of relocation addresses, we can shuffle the individual
+text sections immediately after decompression. You are probably asking
+yourself how this could possibly work given the number of tables of
+addresses that exist inside the kernel today for features such as exception
+handling and kprobes. Most of these tables generate relocations and
+require a simple update, and some tables that have assumptions about order
+require sorting after the update. In order to modify these tables, we
+preserve a few key symbols from the objcopy symbol stripping process for use
+after shuffling the text segments.
+
+Load time
+---------
+
+The boot kernel was modified to parse the vmlinux elf file after
+decompression to check for our interesting symbols that we kept, and to
+look for any .text.* sections to randomize. We then shuffle the sections
+and update any tables that need to be updated or resorted. The existing
+code which updated relocation addresses was modified to account for not
+just a fixed delta from the load address, but the offset that the function
+section was moved to. This requires inspection of each address to see if
+it was impacted by a randomization. In order to hide our new layout,
+symbols reported through /proc/kallsyms will be sorted by name alphabetically
+rather than by address.
+
+Security Considerations
+=======================
+
+The objective of this patch set is to improve a technology that is already
+merged into the kernel (KASLR). Obviously, this code is not a one stop
+shopping place for blocking code reuse attacks, but should instead be
+considered as one of several tools that can be used. In particular, this
+code is meant to make KASLR more effective in the presence of info leaks.
+A key point to note is that we are basically accepting that there are
+many and various ways to leak address today and in the future, and rather
+than assume that we can stop them all, we should find a method which makes
+individual info leaks less important. How much entropy we are adding to
+the existing entropy of standard KASLR will depend on a few variables.
+Firstly and most obviously, the number of functions you randomize matters.
+This implementation keeps the existing .text section for code that cannot be
+randomized - for example, because it was assembly code, or we opted out of
+randomization for performance reasons. The less sections to randomize, the
+less entropy. In addition, due to alignment (16 bytes for x86_64), the number
+of bits in a address that the attacker needs to guess is reduced, as the lower
+bits are identical.
+
+Performance Impact
+==================
+
+There are two areas where function reordering can impact performance: boot
+time latency, and run time performance.
+
+Boot time latency
+-----------------
+
+This implementation of finer grained KASLR impacts the boot time of the kernel
+in several places. It requires additional parsing of the kernel ELF file to
+obtain the section headers of the sections to be randomized. It calls the
+random number generator for each section to be randomized to determine that
+section's new memory location. It copies the decompressed kernel into a new
+area of memory to avoid corruption when laying out the newly randomized
+sections. It increases the number of relocations the kernel has to perform at
+boot time vs. standard KASLR, and it also requires a lookup on each address
+that needs to be relocated to see if it was in a randomized section and needs
+to be adjusted by a new offset. Finally, it re-sorts a few data tables that
+are required to be sorted by address.
+
+Booting a test VM on a modern, well appointed system showed an increase in
+latency of approximately 1 second.
+
+Run time
+--------
+
+The performance impact at run-time of function reordering varies by workload.
+Randomly reordering the functions will cause an increase in cache misses
+for some workloads. You should expect to see some workloads perform
+significantly worse under FGKASLR, while others stay the same or even
+mysteriously improve. In general, it will depend on the code flow whether or
+not finer grained KASLR will impact your workload, and how the underlying code
+was designed.
+
+Image Size
+==========
+
+fgkaslr increases the size of the kernel binary due to the extra section
+headers that are included, as well as the extra relocations that need to
+be added. You can expect fgkaslr to increase the size of the resulting
+vmlinux by about 3%, and the compressed image (bzImage) by 15%.
+
+Building
+========
+
+To enable fine grained KASLR, you need to have the following config options
+set (including all the ones you would use to build normal KASLR)
+
+``CONFIG_FG_KASLR=y``
+
+In addition, fgkaslr is only supported for the X86_64 architecture.
+
+Modules
+=======
+
+Modules are randomized similarly to the rest of the kernel by shuffling
+the sections at load time prior to moving them into memory. The module must
+also have been build with the -ffunction-sections compiler option.
