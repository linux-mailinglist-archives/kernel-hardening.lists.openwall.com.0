I think we need to test both against zero, or maybe invert the logic: if
something is mapped at virtual address zero that doesn't come from a
zero file offset, we disable the ELIBEXEC check.

Yeah, it was quite confusing when it was after begin_new_exec because
the ELIBEXEC error is visible under strace, and then the SIGSEGV comes =E2=
=80=A6

It's usually mapped even with e_entry =3D=3D0 because the ELF header is
loaded at virtual address zero for ET_DYN using the default linker flags
(and this is the case we care about).  With -z noseparate-code, it is
even mapped executable.

To keep supporting this case, we need to check that the ELF header is at
address zero, because we make a leap of faith and assume it's not really
executable even if it is mapped as such because due to its role in the
file format, it does not contain executable instructions.  That's why
the patch is focused on the ELF header.

I could remove all these checks and just return ELIBEXEC for a zero
entry point.  I think this is valid based on the ELF specification, but
it may have a backwards compatibility impact.

It's the ELF header.

I think the range check doesn't help here.  Just checking p_vaddr for
zero in addition to p_offset should be sufficient.  If you agree, can
test and send an updated patch.

Thanks,
