Wouldn't you do it the other way around - so shadow stack overflow
corrupts the bottom of the normal stack?
That can be detected 'after the fact' in a few places (eg process
switch and return to user)

Actually you might want to do syscall entry at the base of stack area,
then (effectively) allocate an on-stack buffer for the shadow stack.

I'd have though that kernel code could be the shadow stack address
by just reading r18?
Userspace isn't supposed to be able to get the main kernel stack
address either.
