Veeery late reply.  Have you had any productive discussions about this in
other threads or venues?

Disabling them altogether would break lots of things depending on them,
like X :)  (@/tmp/.X11-unix/X0).  The other path is to reconsider network
namespaces.  There are several directions this could lead.  For one, as
Dinesh Subhraveti often points out, the current "network" namespace is
really a network device namespace.  If we instead namespace at the
bind/connect/etc calls, we end up with much different abilities.  You
can implement something like this today using seccomp-filter.
