I guess there are two parts to this - what root is allowed to do, and
what information we're fine with exposing to dmesg.

If the lockdown LSM is not set to LOCKDOWN_CONFIDENTIALITY_MAX, the
kernel allows root to read kernel memory through some interfaces - in
particular, BPF allows reading arbitrary kernel memory, and perf
allows reading at least some stuff (like kernel register states). With
lockdown in the most restrictive mode, the kernel tries to prevent
root from reading arbitrary kernel memory, but we don't really change
how much information goes into dmesg. (And I imagine you could
probably still get kernel pointers out of BPF somehow even in the most
restrictive lockdown mode, but that's probably not relevant.)

The main issue with dmesg is that some systems make its contents
available to code that is not running with root privileges; and I
think it is also sometimes stored persistently in unencrypted form
(like in EFI pstore) even when everything else on the system is
encrypted.
So on one hand, we definitely shouldn't print the contents of random
chunks of memory into dmesg without a good reason; on the other hand,
for example we do already print kernel register state on WARN() (which
often includes kernel pointers and could theoretically include more
sensitive data too).

So I think showing page metadata to root when requested is probably
okay as a tradeoff? And dumping that data into dmesg is maybe not
great, but acceptable as long as only root can actually trigger this?

I don't really have a strong opinion on this...


To me, a bigger issue is that dump_page() looks like it might be racy,
which is maybe not terrible in debugging code that only runs when
something has already gone wrong, but bad if it is in code that root
can trigger on demand? __dump_page() copies the given page with
memcpy(), which I don't think guarantees enough atomicity with
concurrent updates of page->mapping or such, so dump_mapping() could
probably run on a bogus pointer. Even without torn pointers, I think
there could be a UAF if the page's mapping is destroyed while we're
going through dump_page(), since the page might not be locked. And in
dump_mapping(), the strncpy_from_kernel_nofault() also doesn't guard
against concurrent renaming of the dentry, which I think again would
probably result in UAF.
So I think dump_page() in its current form is not something we should
expose to a userspace-reachable API.
