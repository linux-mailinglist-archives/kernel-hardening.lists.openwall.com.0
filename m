AFAIK, %p hashing is only exist because of many legacy address printings
and force who really want the raw values to switch to %px or even %lx.
It's not the opposite of debugging. Raw address printing is not
forbidden, only people need to estimate the risk of adrdress leaks.

Turnning to %p may not be a good idea in this situation. So
for the REG logs printed when dumping stack, we can disable it when
KASLR is open. For the REG logs in other places like show_regs(), only
privileged can trigger it, and they are not combind with a symbol, so
I think it's ok to keep them.
