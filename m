I guess this is what the test robot found as well.

This is definitely the simplest option.
I am a bit concerned about performance if massive cache destruction
happens (e.g. maybe during destruction of a set of namespaces for a
container). Net namespace is slow to destroy for this reason IIRC,
there were some optimizations to batch rcu synchronization. And now we
are adding more.
But I don't see any reasonable faster option as well.
So I guess let's do this now and optimize later (or not).
