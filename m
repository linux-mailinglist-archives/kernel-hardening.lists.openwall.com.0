I was talking about PC-relative data references too: they are a
requirement for PIC code that wants to access any global data. They can
be implemented easily on i386 even though it doesn't have an addressing
mode that uses the PC.

This doesn't have anything to do with the ABI, since what happened here
isn't visible to any caller or callee. Any machine instruction sequence
that has the effect of copying the PC into a GPR is acceptable, but this
is basically the only possible solution on i386. If you don't like the
call/pop mismatch (though that's supported by the hardware, and is what
clang likes to use), you can use the slightly different technique used
in my example, which copies the top of stack into a GPR after a call.

This is how all i386 PIC code has always worked.

But you can get even more standardization out of a userspace library,
because that can work even on non-linux OS's, as well as versions of
linux where the new syscall isn't available.

glibc could do this already if it wants, even without the syscall,
because this can be done in userspace already.

The source PC will generally not be available if the compiler decided to
tail-call optimize the call to the trampoline into a jump.

What's special about these trampolines anyway? Any indirect function
call could have these same problems -- an attacker could have
overwritten the pointer the same way, whether it's supposed to point to
a normal function or it is the target of this trampoline.

For making them a bit safer, userspace could just map the page holding
the data pointers/destination address(es) as read-only after
initialization.

We don't need this for FFI_REGISTER. I presented a solution that works
in userspace. Even if you want to use a trampoline created by the
kernel, there's no reason it needs to trap into the kernel at trampoline
execution time. libffi's trampolines already handle this case today.

Applications can use their own userspace trampolines regardless of this
setting, so it doesn't provide any additional security benefit by
preventing usage of trampfd.
