Hi,

Thanks for letting people know about this! I took a quick look through
the patch and I think there are some interesting bits in there. As Greg
mentioned, it would probably be worth splitting these changes out into
separate patches with full commit logs, documentation, etc. Then it'll
be easier to follow the patch submission process[1]. And, similarly,
please send individual patches inline so people can comment on them
directly.

As you've mentioned, this code is still in early stages, but I have
two general observations that might help direct further work:

- Some features are x86-only. What do you think about extending
  those features to other architectures?

- Many of the features are notification-only, in that once a bad
  situation is detected, it will only perform a printk() and do no
  mitigation. It would be best to add situation-specific mitigations
  (though note that the kernel avoids using BUG()[2]).

I have some other notes below...

I think this would be easy to upstream. Perhaps note that this is a
per-boot random value now. And please don't printk the value[3]:
https://github.com/cloudsec/hksp/blob/master/hksp.patch#L986
- you could just redefine CRED_MAGIC to be the global instead of
  changing the code that uses CRED_MAGIC.
- the global credit magic should likely not live in init_cred, since
  that takes up space in every task, and gets copied all over the place.
  I think a single global variable would be better.

In this feature's description, please include a note that it changes the
effort needed by an attacker to needing an additional memory content
exposure to mount such a cred attack now. (i.e. they need to read a
valid cred magic to copy during a cred write attack.)

Is this meant to refer to this code?
https://github.com/cloudsec/hksp/blob/master/hksp.patch#L1000
This only appears to check that prepare_kernel_cred() was called from
kernel space? Given SMEP and KPTI (which has emulated SMEP), is this
check useful on x86?

This is check_pid_ns()? This appears to only get checked on process
death? What's your plan for this check?
https://github.com/cloudsec/hksp/blob/master/hksp.patch#L1140

This is check_stack_pivot()? Same question about only being checked on
process death. Also, why are certain uid ranges excluded from this
check?
https://github.com/cloudsec/hksp/blob/master/hksp.patch#L1043
Also, I think this check needs a lot more specialization because lots of
multithreaded application intentionally put their stacks into the mmap
range. Perhaps a per-process flag that indicated the process's
expectation about its thread stacks?

There is a lot of history here in attempts to track userspace stacks.
You can see it in commits like these that tried to track it and how they
had to be reverted:
https://git.kernel.org/linus/b76437579d13
https://git.kernel.org/linus/65376df58217
https://git.kernel.org/linus/b18cb64ead40

Having something that better attempted to track what a process has done
might be more sensible? (i.e. if it has never called clone(), maybe it
can have a strict stack check, otherwise, something else?)

This is interesting -- are production systems using redzoning?
Regardless, it seems like a reasonable change to provide. Though,
again, please don't print the value. ;)

Is this the code?
https://github.com/cloudsec/hksp/blob/master/hksp.patch#L1377
(Please don't use panic() -- a better attempt to mitigate is needed)

This check appears to be pretty expensive -- it's walking all objects
looking for a duplicate?

Is this the code?
https://github.com/cloudsec/hksp/blob/master/hksp.patch#L1589

What's the benefit of this change? It looks pretty inexpensive; could it
be done by default?

These seem like general changes that could be broken out. I don't see
why there would be much objection to making these less discoverable.
(Though I would point out that most attackers are going to assume all
these features, etc, are enabled.)

This needs some pretty extensive checking and validation that there will
be no memory range collisions. Past changes to ASLR ranges have caused
hard-to-find on-execve() crashes with some unlucky randomization, etc.
But otherwise, yeah, I think it'd be really nice to have this be dynamic
as was done with the mmap ASLR.

Hmm, this looks like duplication of the existing Yama LSM controls?
What's different?

I don't think this works correctly: you're checking the shadow, not the
real CR4. This seems like it somewhat complements the existing pinning?
https://git.kernel.org/linus/873d50d58f67ef15d2777b5e7f7a5268bb1fbae2
I like the idea of doing this kind of sanity checking at process exit,
though. It may be quite expensive, though (reading CR4 is slow).

These all seem pretty reasonable, though I suspect there will be a lot
of push-back under the expectation that there are already controls in
place to avoid these kinds of things (e.g. access to raw sockets is
already restricted). Regardless, I would break these up into individual
patches with justifications and rationales.

These kinds of checks are extremely hard to justify in upstream. Any
system where standard kernel interfaces are being used to subvert the
kernel are basically impossible to defend against. If something is
loading malicious kernel modules, there's virtually no way to defend
the kernel. A better solution is signed kernel modules, etc.

If there is a rationale that isn't solved with kernel module signing,
this will need to be spelled out clearly. (Similarly, if this is a
post-exploitation forensics tool, again, the attacker can just change
how modules are loaded, etc.)

How does this compare to SARA?
https://lore.kernel.org/kernel-hardening/1562410493-8661-1-git-send-email-s.mesoraca16@gmail.com/

I do like the idea of a simple W^X protection in userspace, almost like
the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS flag that will allow a process to declare that
it is not a JIT, etc.

This seems like it could be implemented with the IMA LSM?

Can you describe how this complements kptr_restrict and the %p hashing?
This removes a symbol entirely from the list, but I'm curious what
specific benefit that provides above the other mentioned features?

Which symbols would you suggest get added to this list? (Should there be
a starting baseline block list?)


I look forward to further versions; thanks again for sending this!
