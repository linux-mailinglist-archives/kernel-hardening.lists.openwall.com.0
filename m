(Related, it might be nice if Landlock had a way to completely deny
access to abstract unix sockets, and a way to restrict filesystem unix
sockets with filesystem rules... LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK exists
for restricting bind(), but I don't think there's an analogous
permission for connect().

Currently, when you try to sandbox an application with Landlock, you
have to use seccomp to completely block access to unix domain sockets,
or alternatively use something like the seccomp_unotify feature to
interactively filter connect() calls.

On the other hand, maybe such a feature would be a bit superfluous
when we have seccomp_unotify already... idk.)
