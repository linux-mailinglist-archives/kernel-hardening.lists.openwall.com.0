Hi Alex

I also agree with the summary that Lukas gave here. From my experience
the safety system are always guarded by an external flow monitor (e.g. a
watchdog) that triggers in case the safety relevant workloads slows down
or block (for any reason); given this condition of use, a system that
goes into the panic state is always safe, since the watchdog would
trigger and drive the system automatically into safe state.
So I also don't see a clear advantage of having pkill_on_warn();
actually on the flip side it seems to me that such feature could
introduce more risk, as it kills only the threads of the process that
caused the kernel warning whereas the other processes are trusted to
run on a weaker Kernel (does killing the threads of the process that
caused the kernel warning always fix the Kernel condition that lead to
the warning?)

Thanks
