Uhm, let's consider measurement, I'm more familiar with.

I think the race you wanted to express was that the attacker replaces
the good script, verified with AT_EXECVE_CHECK, with the bad script
after the IMA verification but before the interpreter reads it.

Fortunately, IMA is able to cope with this situation, since this race
can happen for any file open, where of course a file can be not read-
locked.

If the attacker tries to concurrently open the script for write in this
race window, IMA will report this event (called violation) in the
measurement list, and during remote attestation it will be clear that
the interpreter did not read what was measured.

We just need to run the violation check for the BPRM_CHECK hook too
(then, probably for us the O_DENY_WRITE flag or alternative solution
would not be needed, for measurement).

Please, let us know when you apply patches like 2a010c412853 ("fs:
don't block i_writecount during exec"). We had a discussion [1], but
probably I missed when it was decided to be applied (I saw now it was
in the same thread, but didn't get that at the time). We would have
needed to update our code accordingly. In the future, we will try to
clarify better our expectations from the VFS.

Thanks
