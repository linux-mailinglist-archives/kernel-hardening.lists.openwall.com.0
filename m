I would appreciate if you add a check of CPUID and not run the test if =
the=20
feature is not supported.

I run the tests on bare-metal (and other non-KVM environment) from time =
to
time. Doing so allows to find bugs in tests due to wrong assumptions of =
KVM
test developers. Liran runs the tests using QEMU/WHPX (non-KVM). So =
allowing
the tests to run on non-KVM environments is important, at least for some =
of
us, and benefits KVM as well.

While I can disable this specific test using the test parameters, I =
prefer
that the test will first check the environment they run on. Debugging =
test
failures on bare-metal is hard enough without the paravirt stuff noise.
