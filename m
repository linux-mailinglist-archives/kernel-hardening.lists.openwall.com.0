The former. But more precisely, with GKI Google gives a promise, that
when certain GKI is released, i.e. at 4.19, its ABI will never ever
change (or, perhaps only change with <next letter> Android release),
so vendor modules could have an independent development lifecycle. And
this patch, when backported, will help enable boundsan on kernels
where ABI has already been frozen.

I don't understand what you mean here, sorry.

Such setup might be confusing for developers. We were considering
something similar: to keep the in_ubsan field regardless of the
CONFIG_UBSAN option. But since non-trap mode is unlikely to be used on
production devices due to size and performance overheads, I think it's
better to just get rid of an unused field, rather than balloon
task_struct.
