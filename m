This RFC talks about converting dynamic code (which cannot be authenticated)
to static code that can be authenticated using signature verification. That
is the scope of this RFC.

If I have not been clear before, by dynamic code, I mean machine code that is
dynamic in nature. Scripts are beyond the scope of this RFC.

Also, malware compiled from sources is not dynamic code. That is orthogonal
to this RFC. If such malware has a valid signature that the kernel permits its
execution, we have a systemic problem.

I am not saying that script authentication or compiled malware are not problems.
I am just saying that this RFC is not trying to solve all of the security problems.
It is trying to define one way to convert dynamic code to static code to address
one class of problems.
