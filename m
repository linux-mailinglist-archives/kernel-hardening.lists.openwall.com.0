Yup, it would be a nice improvement. It would need some work to reorganize
the shuffler, which doesn't have a way to insert fields currently. It
can sort of calculate padding (see partition_struct()), but that likely
needs improvement too.

Patches welcome! I've opened an issue for this:

Since the RNG runs on every compilation unit on every randomized
structure, any performance hit from swapping the RNG could be large.
That said, folks using randstruct likely don't care. :)

This looks easier to do than the former idea, though. Again, patches
welcome! Issue captured at: https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/123
