Yeah, it's a good idea. I've once used a similar approach locally during
debugging a problem that appeared to be stray writes hitting page tables, and
without PKS I indeed made the whole pages read-only when not touched by the
designated code.

I can see in patch 8/9 that you are flipping the MSR around individual
operations on page table entries. In my patch I hooked making the page table
writable to obtaining the page table lock (IIRC I had only the PTE level fully
handled though). Wonder if that would be better tradeoff even for your MSR approach?
