There are, I think, 3 considerations:

- is "stats", itself, a valid allocation in kernel memory? This is the
  "lifetime" management of the structure: it will only stay allocated as
  long as there is a task still alive that is attached to it. The use of
  refcount_t on task creation/death should entirely solve this issue, so
  that all the other places where you access "stats", the memory will be
  valid. AFAICT, this one is fine: you're doing all the correct lifetime
  management.

- changing a task's stats pointer: this is related to lifetime
  management, but it, I think, entirely solved by the existing
  refcounting. (And isn't helped by holding stats->lock since this is
  about stats itself being a valid pointer.) Again, I think this is all
  correct already in your existing code (due to the implicit locking of
  "current"). Perhaps I've missed something here, but I guess we'll see!

- are the values in stats getting written by multiple writers, or read
  during a write, etc?

This last one is the core of what I think could be improved here:

To keep the writes serialized, you (correctly) perform locking in the
writers. This is fine.

There is also locking in the readers, which I think is not needed.
AFAICT, READ_ONCE() (with WRITE_ONCE() in the writers) is sufficient for
the readers here.

Right -- from what I can see about how you're reading the statistics, I
don't see a way to have the values get confused (assuming locked writes
and READ/WRITE_ONCE()).

No -- you'll still want the writer locked since you update multiple fields
in stats during a write, so you could miss increments, or interleave
count vs jiffies writes, etc. But the WRITE_ONCE() makes sure that the
READ_ONCE() readers will see a stable value (as I understand it), and
in the order they were written.

It's a complex subject! Here are some other docs that might help:

tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt
Documentation/core-api/refcount-vs-atomic.rst

or they may melt your brain further! :) I know mine is always mushy
after reading them.

You're welcome; and thank you for your work on this! I've wanted a robust
brute force mitigation in the kernel for a long time. :)
