Sorry, it's not directly related to your patch, just that if we're removing
options relating to kernel mappings then I'd be quite keen on effectively
forcing page-granularity on the linear map, as is currently done by default
thanks to RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED, so that we can nobble cacheable
aliases for non-coherent streaming DMA mappings by hooking into Christoph's
series above.

This series just reminded me of it because it's another
"off-by-default-behaviour-for-block-mappings-probably-because-of-performance-
but-never-actually-measured" type of thing which really just gets in the
way.
