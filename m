This approach of first creating a normal io_uring instance and then
installing restrictions separately in a second syscall means that it
won't be possible to use seccomp to restrict newly created io_uring
instances; code that should be subject to seccomp restrictions and
uring restrictions would only be able to use preexisting io_uring
instances that have already been configured by trusted code.

So I think that from the seccomp perspective, it might be preferable
to set up these restrictions in the io_uring_setup() syscall. It might
also be a bit nicer from a code cleanliness perspective, since you
won't have to worry about concurrently changing restrictions.
