A bunch of this was discussed in a breakout room during Linux Plumbers
last year and I also had discussions with Lennart about this a little
while ago.

One API I had proposed was to extend pidfd_open() to give you a
pidfd that does not yet refer to any process, i.e. instead of

int pidfd = pidfd_open(1234, 0);

you could do

int pidfd = pidfd_open(-1/-ESRCH, 0);

which would give you an empty process handle without any mentionable
properties.

A simple/dumb design would then be to let clone3() not just return
pidfds but also take pidfds as an argument. You could then hand-off the
pidfd to another process SCM_RIGHTS/pidfd_getfd() and have it create a
process for you with the privileges of the caller, you'd still be the
parent.

Or in addition to pidfd_open() we add new syscalls to configure a
process context pidfd_configure() or sm. This design I initially
proposed before we ended up with what we have now.

So yes, I would love to have at least the concept to create a process
for another process, delegated fork, essentially.
