For my own understanding - we have to keep this mapping (given the
current kernel code and tables handling) which means that this patch
mitigates (correctly) the issue but can't solve it in its entirety.

Nit: IIUC this tweaks the current behaviour (so it is probably better
to move this change to another patch).

Other than that the patch is sound and probably the best we could
do to harden the code, goes without saying - it requires testing.

Thanks for putting it together.
