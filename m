yes.

I feel like trampfd is too poorly defined at this point to evaluate.
There are three general things it could do.  It could generate actual
code that varies by instance.  It could have static code that does not
vary.  And it could actually involve a kernel entry.

If it involves a kernel entry, then it's slow.  Maybe this is okay for
some use cases.

If it involves only static code, I see no good reason that it should
be in the kernel.

If it involves dynamic code, then I think it needs a clearly defined
use case that actually requires dynamic code.

If you're worried about raise() racing against signals from out of
thread, you have bigger problems to deal with.
