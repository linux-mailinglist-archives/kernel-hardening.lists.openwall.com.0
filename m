LD_PRELOAD should be OK once ld.so will be patched to check the
libraries.  We can still imagine a debug library used to bypass security
checks, but in this case the issue would be that this library is
executable in the first place.

As explained in the UAPI comments, all parent processes need to be
trusted.  This meeans that their code is trusted, their seccomp filters
are trusted, and that they are patched, if needed, to check file
executability.

If an attacker is allowed/able to load an arbitrary seccomp filter on a
process, we cannot trust this process.

Being able to check a path name or a file descriptor (with the same
syscall) is more flexible and cover more use cases.  The execveat(2)
interface, including current and future flags, is dedicated to file
execution.  I then think that using execveat(2) for this kind of check
makes more sense, and will easily evolve with this syscall.

If attackers can filter execveat(2), they can also filter open(2) and
any other syscalls.  In all cases, that would mean an issue in the
security policy.
