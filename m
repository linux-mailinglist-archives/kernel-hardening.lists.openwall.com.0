I think I caught a problem here. Have you tested this with
initramfs?

According to init/do_mount.c's
init_rootfs()/rootfs_init_fs_context(), when `root=3D` cmdline
parameter is not empty, kernel creates rootfs of type ramfs
(tmpfs otherwise).
The thing about ramfs is that it doesn't support xattrs.

I'm running this v8 on a regular PC with initramfs and having
`root=3D` in cmdline, and Brute doesn't allow the kernel to run
any init processes (/init, /sbin/init, ...) with err =3D=3D -95
(-EOPNOTSUPP) -- I'm getting a

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 173 at brute_task_execve+0x15d/0x200
<snip>
Failed to execute /init (error -95)

and so on (and a panic at the end).

If I omit `root=3D` from cmdline, then the kernel runs init process
just fine -- I guess because initramfs is then placed inside tmpfs
with xattr support.

As for me, this ramfs/tmpfs selection based on `root=3D` presence
is ridiculous and I don't see or know any reasons behind that.
But that's another story, and ramfs might be not the only one
system without xattr support.
I think Brute should have a fallback here, e.g. it could simply
ignore files from xattr-incapable filesystems instead of such
WARNING splats and stuff.
