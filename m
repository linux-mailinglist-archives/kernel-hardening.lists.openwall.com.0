I just didn't like how difficult it was to review the repeated checking.
I thought then (and still think now) it's worth the unusual style to
improve the immediate readability. Obviously Al disagrees. I'm not
against dropping my suggestion; it's just a pain to review it and it
seems like an area that would be highly prone to subtle typos. Perhaps
some middle ground:

#define sara_warn(msg)	({				\
		if ((sara_wxp_flags & SARA_WXP_VERBOSE))	\
			pr_wxp(msg);				\
		!(sara_wxp_flags & SARA_WXP_COMPLAIN);		\
	})

...

	if (unlikely(sara_wxp_flags & SARA_WXP_WXORX &&
		     vm_flags & VM_WRITE &&
		     vm_flags & VM_EXEC &&
		     sara_warn("W^X")))
		return -EPERM;

that way the copy/pasting isn't present but the control flow is visible?
