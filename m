I was thinking about this, but in the context of the "auto-promote to
acquire" which you didn't like. Issuing a warning should certainly be
simpler.

I think there is no one place where we know these transformations
happen, but rather, need to analyze the IR before transformations,
take note of all the dependent loads headed by volatile+asm, and then
run an analysis after optimizations checking the dependencies are
still there.

We might then even be able to say, "if you get this warning, turn on
CONFIG_ACQUIRE_READ_DEPENDENCIES" (or however the option will be
named). Or some other tricks, like automatically recompile the TU
where this happens with the option. But again, this is not something
that should specifically block LTO, because if we have this, we'll
need to turn it on for everything.
