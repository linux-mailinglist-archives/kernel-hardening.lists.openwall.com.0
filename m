What would really help to comprehend this patch set would be a set of
test scripts, preferably something that you can run easily with
BuildRoot or similar.

Scripts would demonstrate the use cases for the patch set. Then it
would be easier to develop scripts that would underline the corner
cases. I would keep all this out of kselftest shenanigans for now.

I feel that the patch set is hovering in abstractions with examples
that you cannot execute.

I added the patches to standard test CI hack:

https://codeberg.org/jarkko/linux-tpmdd-test

But after I booted up a kernel I had no idea what to do with it. And
all this lenghty discussion makes it even more confusing.

Please find some connection to the real world before sending any new
version of this (e.g. via test scripts). I think this should not be
pulled before almost anyone doing kernel dev can comprehend the "gist"
at least in some reasonable level.

BR, Jarkko
