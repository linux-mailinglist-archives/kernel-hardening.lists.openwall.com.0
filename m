I agree that C11 memory_order_consume is not normally what we want,
given that it is universally promoted to memory_order_acquire.

However, dependent loads from integers are, if anything, more difficult
to defend from the compiler than are control dependencies.  This applies
doubly to integers that are used to index two-element arrays, in which
case you are just asking the compiler to destroy your dependent loads
by converting them into control dependencies.

Which would of course break dependent loads.

This could be quite useful!
