One thing about leaking_addresses.pl is that I'm not sure anyone is
actively using it at this point. I told Tobin I'd help review stuff,
but I don't even have a GPG key with enough signatures to send PRs.
I'm slowly working on figuring that out, but in the meantime I wonder
if we couldn't move it into some self test somehow, so that at least
nobody adds new leaks? Does that seem worth doing?

It would then probably go away as a separate perl script and live
under selftests, which could mean we could drop the reference to the
list. But that's me making it someone else's problem then, kind of :)

Also, I'm switching my e-mail address to tycho@tycho.pizza, so future
replies will be from there.
