Can you clarify?  I=E2=80=99m suspicious that we=E2=80=99re taking past each=
 other.

AT_EXECVE_CHECK solves a problem that there are actions that effectively =E2=
=80=9Cexecute=E2=80=9D a file that don=E2=80=99t execute literal CPU instruc=
tions for it. Sometimes open+read has the effect of interpreting the content=
s of the file as something code-like.

But, as I see it, deny-write is almost entirely orthogonal. If you open a fi=
le with the intent of executing it (mmap-execute or interpret =E2=80=94 make=
s little practical difference here), then the kernel can enforce some policy=
. If the file is writable by a process that ought not have permission to exe=
cute code in the context of the opening-for-execute process, then LSMs need d=
eny-write to be enforced so that they can verify the contents at the time of=
 opening.

But let=E2=80=99s step back a moment: is there any actual sensible security p=
olicy that does this?  If I want to *enforce* that a process only execute ap=
proved code, then wouldn=E2=80=99t I do it be only allowing executing files t=
hat the process can=E2=80=99t write?

The reason that the removal of deny-write wasn=E2=80=99t security =E2=80=94 i=
t was a functionality issue: a linker accidentally modified an in-use binary=
. If you have permission to use gcc or lld, etc to create binaries, and you h=
ave permission to run them, then you pretty much have permission to run what=
ever code you like.

So, if there=E2=80=99s a real security use case for deny-write, I=E2=80=99m s=
till not seeing it.
