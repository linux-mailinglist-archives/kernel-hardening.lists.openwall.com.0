The =E2=80=9CBy the time an attacker can issue prctls=E2=80=9D argument doe=

with me, but I'm not the one who needs convincing.

I can turn this into a toggle, and we could probably default our builds
to vsyscalls=3Dxonly.  Given the userspace ABI impact, we'd still have to
upstream the toggle.  Do you see a chance of a patch a long these lines
going in at all, given that it's an incomplete solution for
vsyscall=3Demulate?

Huh.  KPTI is the new thing, right?  Does it make things harder or not?
I'm confused.

If we knew at execve time that the new process image doesn't have
vsyscall, would that be easier to set up?  vsyscall opt-out could be
triggered by an ELF NOTE segment on the program interpreter (or main
program if there isn't one).

Hmm.  But only for vsyscall=3Dxonly, right?  With vsyscall=3Demulate,
reading at those addresses will still succeed.

Thanks,
