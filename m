Is that provable to the guest?

Consider a cloud provider doing that: how do they prove to their guest:

a) What firmware, kernel and kvm they run

b) That what they booted cannot be maliciouly modified, e.g. by a rogue
   device driver installed by a rogue sysadmin

My understanding is that SecureBoot is only intended to prevent non-verifie=
d
operating systems from booting. So the proof is given to the cloud provider=
,
and the proof is that the system boots successfully.

After that, I think all bets are off. SecureBoot does little AFAICT
to prevent malicious modifications of the running system by someone with
root access, including deliberately loading a malicious kvm-zilog.ko

It does not mean it cannot be done, just that I don=E2=80=99t think we
have the tools at the moment.
