Hmm.  Common LSM configurations should be able to handle this without
deny write, I think.  If you don't want a program to be able to make
their own scripts, then don't allow AT_EXECVE_CHECK to succeed on a
script that the program can write.

Keep in mind that trying to lock this down too hard is pointless for
users who are allowed to to ptrace-write to their own processes.  Or
for users who can do JIT, or for users who can run a REPL, etc.

It wouldn't be so terrible to involve filesystem implementations.
Most of the filesystems that people who care at all about security run
their binaries from either support reflinks or are immutable.  Things
like OCI implementations may already fit meet those criteria, and it
would be pretty nifty if the kernel was actually aware that OCI layers
are intended to be immutable.  We could even have an API to
generically query the hash of an immutable file and to ask the kernel
if it's validating the hash on reads.
