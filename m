We could simply keep the constraints relaxed as necessary.  I didn't
even suggest removing the list from CC on messages sent per git history;
in fact, I don't recall that ever resulting in undesirable messages in
here.  I merely suggested removing the list from the MAINTAINERS file.
I don't see why that couldn't simply be done, but I didn't insist.  What
you're doing now is far worse than keeping the list in MAINTAINERS or
removing it from there, in my opinion.

I think this will most likely result in one of 3 things:

1. 90%+ of messages CC'ed to both lists.

2. Topics arbitrarily limited to just one of the two lists, with no
clear separation on what goes where, and some CC'ed to both lists.

3. Everything staying on/moving to just one of the two lists eventually,
after struggling with 1 or 2 above for a while.

It'll be really hard (almost unrealistic) for us to arrive at a
reasonable topic split between the lists now.  Moreover, I don't know of
such reasonable split even if we could somehow make it happen.

Removing the list from the MAINTAINERS file (maybe replacing it with the
new list as you suggest) wouldn't be significant effort.  If that is
somehow not suitable, we can live with the occasional noise that brings.

My concerns were not related to Openwall hosting the list.  They were
related to well-being of KSPP, no matter where the list is hosted.  So
by moving the list you have not addressed my concerns at all.  You've
only made things far worse.

Messages that are auto-approved don't create any work for either of us,
and that's the majority of them.  Messages that are held for moderation
(until I add the sender to moderation bypass) do involve some work, but
that's the only way to avoid spam on the list.  I think that amount of
work is small compared to all subscribers' time wasted on occasional
spam on the list.  If it's unacceptable for you, I can remove you from
list moderators and maybe add someone else as a co-moderator.  I think
it wouldn't be hard for us to find a volunteer.  Please let me know.

Besides, the split doesn't solve this problem for kernel-hardening@.

OK, let's hope this will work, although I doubt it and I don't know what
topic split is desirable.

That's a major misunderstanding.  I cared primarily about the well-being
of KSPP, and not so much about hosting/administering a list with a
policy I disagree with in a minor way, which I accepted.  I didn't want
to continue that discussion "for very long" as it "hurts actual work",
not because I disagreed with you (although I did) and insisted on that
deciding list policy (I did not, and it did not).  BTW, now we're having
another such discussion that hurts actual work, so I am also not going
to continue it for very long.

If you didn't want to add to a thread given my comment about it hurting,
you could always e-mail me off-list, and I'd tell you that you certainly
did have other choices.

Fair enough, although I only suggested excluding CC's resulting from
MAINTAINERS, which didn't feel fundamental enough to insist on it (so I
did not), let alone to split the list in two.

Actually, that feels like the only valid reason to me.

So your suggested use of kernel-hardening@ is for discussions of Linux
kernel hardening projects or work-in-progress that isn't to be submitted
upstream or isn't yet submitted upstream.  If, and as soon as, a patch
series is sent upstream, that should go on the new linux-hardening@
list?  And only in there or also CC'ed to kernel-hardening@?  I'm just
trying to understand.

I currently don't expect this to work well, but let's see.
