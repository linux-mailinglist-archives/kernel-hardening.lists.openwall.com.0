Ah, yes we can. By checking the CPUID for the feature bit. Thanks for pointing
this out, I was confused about this. I was operating under the assumption that
the unit tests assume the features in the latest kvm/next are present and
available when the unit tests are being run.

I'm happy to add the check, but I haven't see anywhere else where a
KVM_FEATURE_ was checked for. Which is why it doesn't check in this patch. As
soon as I get an answer from you or anyone else as to if the unit tests assume
that the features in the latest kvm/next are present and available or not when
the unit tests are being run I'll modify if necessary.

Thanks,
John
