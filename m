Subject: [PATCH] security: do not enable CONFIG_GCC_PLUGINS by default

On a Galaxy SIII (I9300), the patch mentioned below broke boot:
- The display still had the bootloader logo, while with this
  patch, the 4 Tux logo appears.
- No print appeared on the serial port anymore after the kernel
  was loaded, whereas with this patch, we have the serial
  console working, and the device booting.

Booting was broken by the following commit:
  9f671e58159a ("security: Create "kernel hardening" config area")

As the bootloader of this device enables the MMU, I had the following
patch applied during the tests:

      ANDROID: arm: decompressor: Flush tlb before swiching domain 0 to client mode

      If the bootloader used a page table that is incompatible with domain 0
      in client mode, and boots with the mmu on, then swithing domain 0 to
      client mode causes a fault if we don't flush the tlb after updating
      the page table pointer.

      v2: Add ISB before loading dacr.
