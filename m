There is a new proposal:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240710.eiKohpa4Phai@digikod.net/
The new securebits will be SECBIT_EXEC_RESTRICT_FILE and
SECBIT_EXEC_DENY_INTERACTIVE.  I'll send a new patch series with that.

Restricting ptrace was a cautious approach, but I get you point and I
agree.  I'll remove the ptrace restrictions in the next patch series.

Right, no kernel parts (e.g. LSMs) should try to infer anything other
than an executability check.  We should handle things such as role
transitions with something else (e.g. a complementary dedicated flag),
and that should be decorrelated from this patch series.

Call the kernel for what?  Script interpreter is a user space thing, and
restrictions enforced on interpreters need to be a user space thing.
The kernel cannot restrict user space according to a semantic only
defined by user space, such as Python interpretation, CLI arguments,
content of environment variables...  If a process wants to interpret
some data and turn than into code, there is no way for the kernel to
know about that.

That is the definition of the new SECBIT_EXEC_DENY_INTERACTIVE, which
should be clearer.

That's a good idea, but I guess Content-Security-Policy cannot be
directly applied here.  My understanding is that CSP enables web servers
to request restrictions on code they provide.  In the
AT_CHECK+securebits case, the policy is defined and enforced by the
interpreter, not necessarily the script provider. One big difference is
that web servers (should) know the scripts they provide, and can then
request the browser to ensure that they do what they should do, while
the script interpreter trusts the kernel to check security properties of
a script.  In other words, something like CSP could be implemented with
AT_CHECK+securebits and a LSM policy (e.g. according to file's xattr).
