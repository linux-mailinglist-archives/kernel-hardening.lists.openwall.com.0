One of the major gaps, defining a system wide policy requiring all code
being executed to be signed, is interpreters.  The kernel has no
context for the interpreter's opening the file.  From an IMA
perspective, this information needs to be conveyed to the kernel prior
to ima_file_check(), which would allow IMA policy rules to be defined
in terms of O_MAYEXEC.

The interpreter itself would be signed.
