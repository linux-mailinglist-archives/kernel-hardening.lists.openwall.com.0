Ah, I just saw that. Makes more sense now -- so my patch actually saves
~4MiB even now for bz2-compressed bzImages.

There's another thing I noticed -- you would need to ensure that the
init_size in the header covers your boot heap even if you did split it
out. The reason is that the bootloader will only know to reserve enough
memory for init_size: it's possible it might put the initrd or something
else following the kernel, or theoretically there might be reserved
memory regions or the end of physical RAM immediately following, so you
can't assume that area will be available when you get to extract_kernel.
