Thanks, I missed that. It's annoying that we'll end up needing /both/
-ffixed-x18 *and* the save/restore around guest transitions, but if we
actually want to use SCS for the VHE code then I see that it will be
required.

Sami -- can you restore -ffixed-x18 and then try the function attribute
as suggested by James, please?
