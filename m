Hi Kees, Thanks for your comments.

Yes, time base is similar to RDTSC here.

The fsl booke TLB1 covers the whole low memeory. AFAIK, there is no page 
table performance impact. But if anyone knows there is any regressions, 
please let me know.

The boot code only maps one 64M zone at early start. If the kernel 
crosses two 64M zones, we need to map two 64M zones. Keep the kernel in 
one 64M saves a lot of complex codes.

Yes, if this feature can be accepted, I will start to work with 
powerpc64 KASLR and other things like CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY.
