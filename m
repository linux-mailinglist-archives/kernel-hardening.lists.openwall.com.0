I missed that email in the pile, sorry. I=E2=80=99ll reply separately.

I=E2=80=99m not really convinced.  There=E2=80=99s more to building an API =
that
enables LSM hooks than merely sticking the hook somewhere in kernel
code. It needs to be a defined API. If you call an operation =E2=80=9Ccheck=
=E2=80=9D,
then people will expect it to check, not to change the caller=E2=80=99s
credentials.  And people will mess it up in both directions (e.g.
callers will call it and then open try to load some library that they
should have loaded first, or callers will call it and forget to close
fds first.

And there should probably be some interaction with dumpable as well.
If I =E2=80=9Ccheck=E2=80=9D a file for executability, that should not sudd=
enly allow
someone to ptrace me?

And callers need to know to exit on failure, not carry on.


More concretely, a runtime that fully opts in to this may well "check"
multiple things.  For example, if I do:

$ ld.so ~/.local/bin/some_program   (i.e. I literally execve ld.so)

then ld.so will load several things:

~/.local/bin/some_program
libc.so
other random DSOs, some of which may well be in my home directory

And for all ld.so knows, some_program is actually an interpreter and
will "check" something else.  And the LSMs have absolutely no clue
what's what.  So I think for this to work right, the APIs need to be a
lot more expressive and explicit:

check_library(fd to libc.so);  <-- does not transition or otherwise drop pr=
ivs
check_transition_main_program(fd to ~/.local/bin/some_program);  <--
may drop privs

and if some_program is really an interpreter, then it will do:

check_library(fd to some thing imported by the script);
check_transition_main_program(fd to the actual script);

And maybe that takes a parameter that gets run eval-style:

check_unsafe_user_script("actual contents of snippet");

The actual spelling of all this doesn't matter so much.  But the user
code and the kernel code need to be on the same page as to what the
user program is doing and what it's asking the kernel program to do.
