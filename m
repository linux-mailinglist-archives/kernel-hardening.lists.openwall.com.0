I'm not, what I'm saying is you haven't proved it can be used to
exfiltrate secrets.  In a world where the PCI device is expected to be
correct, and the non-CC kernel doesn't want to second guess that, there
are loads of lies you can tell to the PCI subsystem that causes a crash
or a hang.  If we fix every one, we end up with a massive patch set and
a huge potential slow down for the non-CC kernel.  If there's no way to
tell what lies might leak data, the fuzzing results are a mass of noise
with no real signal and we can't even quantify by how much (or even if)
we've improved the CC VM attack surface even after we merge the huge
patch set it generates.

The PCI people have already said that crashing in the face of bogus
configuration data is expected behaviour, so just generating the crash
doesn't prove there's a problem to be fixed.  That means you do have to
go beyond and demonstrate there could be an information leak in a CC VM
on the back of it, yes.

So perhaps making it a controlled panic in the CC VM, so we can
guarantee no information leak, would be the first place to start?

Right, but if you can't decide that, you can't extract the signal from
your fuzzing tool noise.

The PCI people have already been clear that adding a huge framework of
checks to PCI table parsing simply for the promise it "might possibly"
improve CC VM security is way too much effort for too little result. 
If you can hone that down to a few places where you can show it will
prevent a CC information leak, I'm sure they'll be more receptive. 
Telling them to disprove your assertion that there might be an exploit
here isn't going to make them change their minds.
