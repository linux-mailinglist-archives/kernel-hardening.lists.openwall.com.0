Accidental... malicious...  Note that when people run programs as root with
reduced or no capabilities they can still write this file.

Regardless of the "real value" of it, I know for a fact there are lots
of teams out there adding kernel patches to just change the mode of that
file.  Why?  Possibly to satisfy a scanner, because another team says
it's important.

The problem with lockdown is it's all or nothing.  The problem with LSM
for this purpose is that everyone will have to configure their policy
differently.

So I do think it was worth testing the waters with this patch, to reduce
the number of duplicate patches people run with.
