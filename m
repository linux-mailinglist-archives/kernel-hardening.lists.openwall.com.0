11.0.5 is AOSP's clang, which is behind the upstream 11.0.0 release so
it is most likely the case that it is missing the patch that added rcpc.
I think that a version based on the development branch (12.0.0) is in
the works but I am not sure.

I am personally fine with that. As far as I am aware, we are in a fairly
good spot on arm64 and x86_64 when it comes to the integrated assembler.
Should we make it so that the user has to pass LLVM_IAS=1 explicitly or
we just make adding the no integrated assembler flag to CLANG_FLAGS
depend on not LTO (although that will require extra handling because
Kconfig is not available at that stage I think)?

Cheers,
Nathan
