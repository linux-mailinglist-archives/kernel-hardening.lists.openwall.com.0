The fact that IMA doesn't cover all metadata, file names nor the file 
hierarchies is well known and the solution can be implemented with 
dm-verity (which has its own drawbacks).

trusted_for is a tool for interpreters to enforce a security policy 
centralized by the kernel. The kind of file confusion attacks you are 
talking about should be addressed by a system policy. If the mount point 
options are not enough to express such policy, then we need to rely on 
IMA, SELinux or IPE to reduce the scope of legitimate mapping between 
scripts and interpreters.

Well, this doesn't scale and that is the reason trusted_for usage is 
more generic. The kernel already has all the information required to 
identify scripts and interpreters types. We don't need to make the user 
space interface more complex by listing all types. The kernel only miss 
the semantic of how the intrepreter wants to interpret files, and that 
is the purpose of trusted_for. LSMs are designed to define complex 
policies and trusted_for enables them to extend such policies.

The current use case for trusted_for is script interpreters, but we can 
extend the trusted_for_usage enum with new usages like TRUSTED_FOR_LINK 
and others. I'm not convinced glibc should be treated differently than 
other executable code that want to load a shared library, but it is a 
discussion we can have when trusted_for will be in mainline and someone 
will propose a new usage. ;)

Indeed, it enables to add semantic to audit events.
