While all developers agree that ThinLTO is a much more palatable
experience than full LTO; our product teams prefer the excessive build
time and memory high water mark (at build time) costs in exchange for
slightly better performance than ThinLTO in <benchmarks that I've been
told are important>.  Keeping support for full LTO in tree would help
our product teams reduce the amount of out of tree code they have.  As
long as <benchmarks that I've been told are important> help
sell/differentiate phones, I suspect our product teams will continue
to ship full LTO in production.
