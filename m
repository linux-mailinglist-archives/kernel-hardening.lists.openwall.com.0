This needs *waaaaay* more detail for any sort of useful evaluation.
Is an actual credible security policy rolling dice?  Asking ChatGPT?
Looking at security labels?  Does it care who can write to the file,
or who owns the file, or what the file's hash is, or what filesystem
it's on, or where it came from?  Does it dynamically inspect the
contents?  Is it controlled by an unprivileged process?

I can easily come up with security policies for which DENYWRITE is
completely useless.  I can come up with convoluted and
not-really-credible policies where DENYWRITE is important, but I'm
honestly not sure that those policies are actually useful.  I'm
honestly a bit concerned that AT_EXECVE_CHECK is fundamentally busted
because it should have been parametrized by *what format is expected*
-- it might be possible to bypass a policy by executing a perfectly
fine Python script using bash, for example.

I genuinely have not come up with a security policy that I believe
makes sense that needs AT_EXECVE_CHECK and DENYWRITE.  I'm not saying
that such a policy does not exist -- I'm saying that I have not
thought of such a thing after a few minutes of thought and reading
these threads.

As mentioned above, even AT_EXECVE_CHECK does not obviously accomplish
this goal.  If it were genuinely useful, I would much, much prefer a
totally different API: a *syscall* that takes, as input, a file
descriptor of something that an interpreter wants to execute and a
whole lot of context as to what that interpreter wants to do with it.
And I admit I'm *still* not convinced.

Seriously, consider all the unending recent attacks on LLMs an
inspiration.  The implications of viewing an image, downscaling the
image, possibly interpreting the image as something containing text,
possibly following instructions in a given language contained in the
image, etc are all wildly different.  A mechanism for asking for
general permission to "consume this image" is COMPLETELY MISSING THE
POINT.  (Never mind that the current crop of LLMs seem entirely
incapable of constraining their own use of some piece of input, but
that's a different issue and is besides the point here.)
