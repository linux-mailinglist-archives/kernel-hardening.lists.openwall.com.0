Apology, my response isn't clear.

=E2=80=9Cexecute=E2=80=9D a file that don=E2=80=99t execute literal CPU ins=

Yes. We have the same understanding of this.
As an example, shell script or java byte code, their file permission
can be rw, but no x bit set. The interpreter reads those and executes
them.

 file with the intent of executing it (mmap-execute or interpret =E2=80=94 =
makes little practical difference here), then the kernel can enforce some p=

to execute code in the context of the opening-for-execute process, then LSM=

I imagine the following situation: an app has both "rw" access to the
file that holds the script code, the "w" is needed because the app
updates the script sometimes.

What is a reasonable sandbox solution for such an app? There are maybe
two options:

1> split the app as two processes: processA has "w" access to the
script for updating when needed. Process B has "r" access but no "w",
for executing. ProcessA and ProcessB will coordinate to avoid racing
on the script update.

2> The process will use AT_EXECVE_CHECK (added by interpreter) to
validate the file before opening , and the file content held by the
process should be immutable while being validated and executed later
by interpreter.

option 1 is the ideal, and IIUC, you promote this too. However, that
requires refactoring the app as two processes.
option 2 is an alternative. Because it doesn't require the change from
the apps, therefore a solution worth considering.

Although the current patch might not be ideal due to the potential DOS
attack, it does offer a starting point to address the needs. Let's
continue the discussion based on this patch and explore different
ideas.
