I recall this.  That doesn't mean I totally love AT_EXECVE_CHECK.  And
it especially doesn't mean that I believe that it usefully does
something that justifies anything like DENYWRITE.

Sure, but I'm contemplating DENYWRITE, and this thread is about
DENYWRITE.  If the kernel is enforcing W^X, then there are really two
almost unrelated things going on:

1. LSM policy that enforces W^X for memory mappings.  This is to
enforce that applications don't do nasty things like having executable
stacks, and it's a mess because no one has really figured out how JITs
are supposed to work in this world.  It has almost nothing to do with
execve except incidentally.

2. LSM policy that enforces that someone doesn't execve (or similar)
something that *that user* can write.  Or that non-root can write.  Or
that anyone at all can write, etc.

I think, but I'm not sure, that you're talking about #2.  So maybe
there's a policy that says that one may only exec things that are on
an fs with the 'exec' mount option.  Or maybe there's a policy that
says that one may only exec things that are on a readonly fs.  In
these specific cases, I believe in AT_EXECVE_CHECK.  *But* I don't
believe in DENYWRITE: in the 'exec' case, if an fs has the exec option
set, that doesn't change if the file is subsequently modified.  And if
an fs is readonly, then the file is quite unlikely to be modified at
all and will certainly not be modified via the mount through which
it's being executed.  And you don't need DENYWRITE.

So I think my question still stands: is there a credible security
policy *that actually benefits from DENYWRITE*?  If so, can you give
an example?

That's a sort of odd way of putting it.  The kernel won't execute it
because the kernel doesn't know how to :)  But I think I understand
what you're saying.
