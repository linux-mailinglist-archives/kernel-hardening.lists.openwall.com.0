I hear you. BTW, I did not say that the overhead was trivial.
I only said that in most cases, applications may not mind that
extra overhead.

However, since multiple people have raised that as an issue,
I will address it. I mentioned before that the kernel can actually
supply the code page that sets the context and jumps to
a PC and map it so the performance issue can be addressed.
I was planning to do that as a future enhancement.

If there is a consensus that I must address it immediately, I
could do that.

I will continue this discussion in my reply to Andy's email. Let
us pick it up from there.

Thanks.
