Commit log length vs "11 files changed, 1159 insertions(+), 15
deletions(-)" implies to me that a lot more detail is needed here. ;)

Perhaps describe what the code pieces are, why the code is being added
are here, etc (I see at least the ELF parsing, the ELF shuffling, the
relocation updates, the symbol list, and the re-sorting of kallsyms,
ORC, and extables. I think the commit log should prepare someone to read
the diff and know what to expect to find. (In the end, I wonder if these
pieces should be split up into logically separate patches, but for now,
let's just go with it -- though I've made some suggestions below about
things that might be worth splitting out.)

Yay documentation! Are you able to include the references to the papers
you discuss in the cover letter in here too?

CONFIG_FG_KASLR is already gated by CONFIG_X86-64, so I think you can
just put these all on the same line before the ifdef:

vmlinux-objs-$(CONFIG_FG_KASLR) += $(obj)/utils.o $(obj)/fgkaslr.o

Given the creation of the Elf_Shdr etc macros in the header, should all
of the Elf64 things in here be updated to use the size-agnostic macros?
(Is anyone actually going to run a 32-bit kernel with fgkaslr some day?)

Comments nitpick while I'm thinking about it: "This is" tends to be
redundant, and I'd pick a single-sentence-comment punctuation style:
i.e. with or without an ending period. I personally prefer including the
period, but mainly I think it should just be consistent. :)

Can any of this kallsyms sorting code be reasonably reused instead
of copy/pasting? Or is this mostly novel in that it's taking the output
of that earlier sort, which isn't the input format scripts/kallsyms.c
uses?

Now that the earlier linking glitches have been sorted out, I wonder if
it might be nicer to add this as a separate compilation unit, similar to
how early_serial_console.c is done? (Or, I guess, more specifically, why
can't this be in utils.c?)

Yeah, I'm glad this is captured in a comment. I'm fine leaving this
as it is for now, but it's certainly an area I'd like to look at again
in the future. I think we could gain some performance by removing this
copy. The KASLR code could choose two kernel-image-sized slots, decompress
into one (which would effectively be "stash" above) and the fgkaslr code
could write the resulting image into the second slot. For now, though,
this doesn't really matter: we just get a double-size image area and
copy the kernel around an extra time. :)

Perhaps just globally prefix all the needed image symbols with "loader_"
or "fgkaslr_" or "img_", and then you don't need to open-code this one
with a different target name. Something like this:

#define GET_SYM(name)							\
	do {								\
		if (!img_ ## name) {					\
			if (strcmp(#name, strtab + sym->st_name) == 0) {\
				img_ ## name = sym->st_value;		\
				continue;				\
			}						\
		}							\
	} while (0)

Then there is also a consistent naming convention within the code here
to easily see where addresses came from, and you avoid any future
collisions like are being avoided for the ex_table symbols.

I would assert this claim in the code as well: check symtab is NULL here?

Similar robustness check?

Check text is still NULL here?

Also, why the continue? This means the section isn't included in the
sections[] array? (Obviously things still work, but I don't understand
why.)

Similar, check percpu is still NULL here?

Also, is a "continue" intended here? (This is kind of the reverse of
the "continue" question above.) I think you get the same result during
the next "if", but I was expecting this block to look like the .text
test above.

Can you split the STATIC macro rearrangement out into a separate patch?
I think it deserves a dedicated commit log to explain why it's changing
the way it is (i.e. we end up with "STATIC" no longer meaning "static"
in misc.c now...)

I don't think "(void)" needed here?

Hmmm. There is repeated logic between parse_sections_headers() and the
rest of parse_elf() here. I think if they should stay distinct, I would
split the remaining code in parse_elf() into a separate function, and
then parse_elf() becomes more readable as:

void parse_elf(...)
{
	if (fgkaslr)
		layout_fgkaslr(...)
	else
		layout_normal(...)
}

Does "layout" seem to be a good name here? Maybe "parse_elf" needs to
be "layout_image"? Yay name bikesheds. My main point is that the
"return" above feels abrupt, and begs the question, "why aren't we doing
this other stuff?" But if it's a boolean between two layout functions,
that's easy to understand, IMO.
