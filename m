In this case, part of the issue with livepatching appears to be a more
general issue with objtool and how it creates the orc unwind entries
when you have >64K sections. So livepatching is a good test case for
making sure that the orc tables are actually correct. However, the
other issue with livepatching (the duplicate symbols), might be worth
deferring if the solution is complex - I will keep that in mind as I
look at it more closely.
