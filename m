I don't understand the "deterministic interleaved path rules" part.


What if I have a policy like this?

/home/user READ
/home/user/Downloads READ+WRITE

That's a reasonable policy, right?

If I then try to open /home/user/Downloads/foo in WRITE mode, the loop
will first check against the READ+WRITE rule for /home/user, that
check will pass, and then it will check against the READ rule for /,
which will deny the access, right? That seems bad.


The v22 code ensured that for each layer, the most specific rule (the
first we encounter on the walk) always wins, right? What's the problem
with that?

From the interdiff between v23 and v24 (git range-diff

This change also made it so that disconnected paths aren't accessible
unless they're internal, right? While previously, the access could be
permitted if the walk stops before reaching the disconnected point? I
guess that's fine, but it should probably be documented.
