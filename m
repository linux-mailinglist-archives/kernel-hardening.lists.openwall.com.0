Thanks, Linus.
And what do you think about the proposed pkill_on_warn?

Let me quote the rationale behind it.

Currently, the Linux kernel provides two types of reaction to kernel warnings:
 1. Do nothing (by default),
 2. Call panic() if panic_on_warn is set. That's a very strong reaction,
    so panic_on_warn is usually disabled on production systems.

From a safety point of view, the Linux kernel misses a middle way of handling
kernel warnings:
 - The kernel should stop the activity that provokes a warning,
 - But the kernel should avoid complete denial of service.

From a security point of view, kernel warning messages provide a lot of useful
information for attackers. Many GNU/Linux distributions allow unprivileged users
to read the kernel log (for various reasons), so attackers use kernel warning
infoleak in vulnerability exploits. See the examples:
https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2021/02/09/CVE-2021-26708.html
https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2020/02/15/CVE-2019-18683.html
https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/09/a-cache-invalidation-bug-in-linux.html

Let's introduce the pkill_on_warn parameter.
If this parameter is set, the kernel kills all threads in a process that
provoked a kernel warning. This behavior is reasonable from a safety point of
view described above. It is also useful for kernel security hardening because
the system kills an exploit process that hits a kernel warning.

Linus, how do you see the proper way of handling WARN_ON() in kthreads if
pkill_on_warn is enabled?

Thanks!

Best regards,
Alexander
