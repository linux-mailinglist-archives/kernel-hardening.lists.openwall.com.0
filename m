Sounds good. I'll make it this way in the next revision. I'll do the same for
CR0 (unless I hear otherwise). I've added the last paragraph here under the
ALLOWED MSRs data section.

data:
        Bits which may be pinned.

        Attempting to pin bits other than these will result in a failure when
        writing to the respective CR pinned MSR.

        Bits which are allowed to be pinned default to WP for CR0 and SMEP,
        SMAP, and UMIP for CR4.

        The host VMM may modify the set of allowed bits. However, only the above
        have been tested to work. Allowing the guest to pin other bits may or
        may not be compatible with KVM.
