Several people use it, as I see reports all the time when someone can
trigger a warn on from user space, and it's listed as a DOS of the
system.

WARN() Should never be used just because of laziness. If it is, then
that's a bug. Let's not use that as an excuse to shoot down this
proposal. WARN() should only be used to test assumptions where you do
not believe something can happen. I use it all the time when the logic
prevents some state, and have the WARN() enabled if that state is hit.
Because to me, it shows something that shouldn't happen happened, and I
need to fix the code.

Basically, WARN should be used just like BUG. But Linus hates BUG,
because in most cases, these bad areas shouldn't take down the entire
kernel, but for some people, they WANT it to take down the system.

pr_warn() can be used for things that the user can hit. I'll use
pr_warn, for memory failures, and such. Something that says "we ran out
of resources, this will not work the way you expect". That is perfect
for pr_warn. But not something that requires a stack dump.

Because really, WARN() == BUG() but like I said, Linus doesn't like
taking down the entire system on these areas.

The panic_on_warn() has been used for years now. I do not think this is
an issue.

We can easily check if the thread is a kernel thread or a user thread,
and make the decision on that.
