I don't follow you here. Maybe I've misread the patches but AFAIU the large
page is broken at allocation time and 4k pages remain 4k pages afterwards.

In my understanding the problem with a simple shrinker is that even if we
have the entire 2M free it is not being reinstated as 2M page in the direct
mapping.
